        <div class=post>
            So today I got the chance to write the following:

I am excited and enthused to formally accept IBM's employment offer as a
Software Engineer...


It felt so weird to write those words, actually writing them was fine but pressing the send button was the hard thing. I literally had my mouse sitting on the send button for several minutes. Waiting for what? I don't exactly know, but I can guess it is a mix of excitement, shock, fear, and thankfulness.

Like the title says, here now is "the beginning of the rest of my life". A lot of words which don't make much sense , but they do indicate the feeling that I have at a turning point in my life. Anytime you step out into a new place, even if you you are looking forward to it (even highly so), it causes worry. A little bit of fear is always a part of change, but this is a good thing. I will never be able to perform my best at IBM if I'm not scared of not doing well enough.

Here's to a good start, hoping for the best for me and for IBM.
