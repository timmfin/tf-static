            Bummer,  3 halves of soccer (I played a game and a half tonight, long story) and six goals scored on me. Not soo good. Yea, yea some of them were ridiculously lucky shots, but some were also big mistakes by me. Well, can't win them all and I've had way to much success in intramural soccer to complain. There is always next semester, and after that I sure hope I find somewhere to keep on playing soccer.

I got a few big days comming up. Flying up to Boston (well actually to Westford) tomorrow to visit IBM. I'll be back Friday night so its a very quick trip, but I think it will be very helpful to talk to other employees there to get a feel for the environment, social life. Basically all surrounding factors that are a part of the job, yet not in the description. Looking forward to it :).
