            Everything is better now, but I had drastic computer problems over the weekend.  <em>Note: Dorkiness ahead, read at your own risk.</em>

Whenever my Linux box starts crashing, I really know that there are problems. After a few frustrating days, I figured out that the fan on my video card was dying. It would spin up for a few seconds and then stop causing the chip to overheat whenever it was given a decent load.

So the first thing I tried to do (of course) was take the card out and try to take apart and fix the fan. That didn't work, so I ripped the old fan out and made a makeshift replacement with another fan from inside my case (yeah for zip ties, look at the picture). So I ended end with a pretty ghetto-looking video card, but hey it works.

Oh and to top that all off, in the process of fixing/troubleshooting I really screwed over my system files. It doesn't help that   my older hard drives are going really flaky now, I have had quite a few problems with corrupted data. I don't think I had to do a complete reinstall, but it seemed that it was a good time.
