            Its a good thing I have no desire to get married anytime soon since I've been at two weddings in two weeks. This one was for my oldest cousin, the first of my generation in my family to get married. It was a nice quiant wedding and a fun reception at the Officers Club on the Quantico military base. James (my brother) and I made sure that we left an impression on the dance floor. Is it disrespectful to dance with the groom's mother-in-law? :) Best of luck to Mike and Cassie Vorgang!

Other than that I have plenty of time to relax and hang out with family this weekend. I'll finally get to cashing those paychecks that have been laying around since my bank actually exists in this area.

Its been good to hang out with my mom. She is doing amazingly well currently considering that she had two serious surgeries only two weeks ago.  But our family has always known that she was a tough woman, keep it up Mom! Thanks so very much to the Sinnen family for taking care of her during the summer. After that, time for her to move up to Rochester to move and settle in to her new dream house.
