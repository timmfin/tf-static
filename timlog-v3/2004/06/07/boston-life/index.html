            So here I am, quiet country-ish boy in a city. Quite interesting. I definitely like the fact that I can walk most places or take the T (Boston Mass Transit or metro to you in MD). I've been around the city some but still not near enough to really get a feel for what the city is like (particularly at night). I've never been to a club before or anything night-scene related. Maybe I should give it a try so I can at least say that I gave it a chance :). But hey, ya never know. Work is starting to heat up. This going to be the first time in my life where I'll probably place time as a higher commodity than money. I'll try to cook meals when I can, but thats probably only going to happen a few times a week. The time commitment is not really <em>that</em> bad though, especially since I don't seem to be doing much with my free time anyway. Till next time.
