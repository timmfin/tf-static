        <div class=post>
            So its finally time to take my leave back to good ole' MD. I've had quite a time here in Boston, and I'm quite attracted to come back some time, but for now I'd rather not have to worry about more career choices (although I do need to be making some important decisions soon).  


I should take the time to write out more of my thoughts about this summer. It certainly has been one to remember. Well, thats for another time though. I need to pack and get ready to move out. Another thing is that my car, which hasn't moved one inch since I drove to Boston, has a dead battery.  I can look forward to trying to get someone from the gas station to give me a jump nice and early in the morning.
