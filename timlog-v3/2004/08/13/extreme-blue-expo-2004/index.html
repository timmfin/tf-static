            <em>Note: I wrote this on the bus last Tuesday, just putting it up now.</em>

Whew, that was a tiring few days. I honestly came in very worried that our project, demos, etc would merely be lackluster – fortunately I was very wrong. We (FLOOD) were no big stars, but there were several interested folks from technical to executive positions. Our presentation went well. I still messed up a few words, but no one would really notice (except those who have heard us say our presentation several times over).

Other things, the Learning Center was wonderful (it's the IBM hotel/dorms on the corporate headquarters campus). The food was great, talking with executives was a special treat. Now I feel much more comfortable speaking to others, especially others whom seem important, intimidating, etc. 

I'm truly amazed at the focus IBM gives this Extreme Blue program. Getting the chance to hear from the chairman, senior vp's etc is a rare occasion for most IBM employees, but it is standard procedure for the EB expo. Even better was the fact that all the good things I'm hearing about IBM about Linux, OSS, standards, and IP seem to be really going on (as in that IBM is truly making the effort to open up, and stay away from the model that some other *cough* M$ *cough* companies are doing).

What else. Career stuff. A few opportunities have popped up, at least one that is very interesting. The unfortunate thing is that this continues to make my graduate school decision significantly more difficult. If I get an enticing enough job, I just may go ahead and take it. Is there necessarily any reason to study in a specific subject that you can go straight to working in (and making money). Grad school does provide some freedom, but that comes along with its own difficulties.

Well, I think that I need a nap (yes I'm tired enough to pass out on the bus)…
