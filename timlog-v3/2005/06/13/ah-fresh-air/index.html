            Already at the third day of the trip, but we are ahead of schedule. We made very good time getting out to Colorado â€“ probably around 26 hours of total driving. On Saturday night we did get well into Missouri and slept for the night in the car at a rest stop (nice and cheap :)).
	
Sunday's drive went pretty smoothly, well all except for Pete's speeding ticket.  And the fact that Kansas is long, it took forever to get through that state. Our trek along I-70 was pretty monotonous until we reached the end of Kansas and got into Colorado. I was amazed by the blueness of the sky, skies I'm used to on the East coast seem to pale in comparison. It probably does help that you can see for miles and miles in any direction, making the sky seem dramatically immense. Other than a few heavy rainstorms we drove to our first destination to the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs. The rock formations were impressive, but not as nearly as much as I was expecting. Still, it was a nice place and made sure to grab way too many pictures (I'll upload some when I get a higher bandwidth link).

That's it for now, hopefully today will be a nice day to hike around Pike's Peak.
