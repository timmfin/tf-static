            Arg... well we got back today, but unfortunately my car didn't make it back with us. On I-70 in Maryland (around 15 mins north of Fredrick), someone backed into my car while we were pulling out of the parking lot :(. Its really not too bad, mostly cosmetic damage around the wheel well, though there is a chance that the wheel is bent/unbalanced. It was bent up enough that the metal was rubbing against the wheel, so driving it more than a few feet would probably be a bad idea.

I'm nearly sure that this is not my fault, especially since my car was already mostly past his parked vehicle - basically broadsiding me - so insurance should cover all the costs. Still though, its a hassle since I'm supposed to move to Mass. next week. I have a few options but its probably going to be best to delay my starting date until the car is fixed.  ARGGG....

Well, at least I'm fortunate enough that this happened close to home (and after the trip rather than before), the situation could have been much worse. I should probably be thankful that my first accident happened in parking lot at 10 miles an hour instead of on the highway at 60.

Such is life.
