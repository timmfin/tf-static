        <div class=post>
            Time to switch more over to the real world and less of the <span style="font-style: italic;">meta</span> of <a title="last post" href="http://www.timmfin.net/?p=130">last post</a>. So whats been going on?<br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Good 'ol regular life</span><br /> I put this first so I can get rid of the least exciting one first... No, really it hasn't been <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> bad. <a title="Steve" href="http://spi.panaverse.com/journal/">Steve</a> and I are still hanging in our functional sans-decorative apartment and occasionally getting out to go somewhere else than work. I've been playing soccer on the weekends, joined up on a co-ed team but that season has already ended. We had quite a run, but despite being undefeated we lost in the first round of playoffs (bummer, our excuse is that we were missing a few of our better players). It was good to get back on the field again, especially to rust off my field skills (I actually did score a few goals, though not as the UMD 6 a side intramural dribble-up-as-the-goalie-and-score-after-running-the-whole-field. I actually played forward :) ). We also had quite the frigid time playing during Boston's first snowfall -- and yes, soccer deteriorates quickly in the snow... it just doesn't really work.<br /> <br /> Otherwise, I've gone out on the town a few times. I bested a last minute farmers costume (full with suspenders, tools, and hat) for a Halloween party and had a bit <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span> much fun that night. Another notable time was going out to a karoke bar with the soccer team. Although the average age of our group (quite a big group actually) and the rest of the place was quite different (no so much the happening spot) we still had a good time, and I got to do my rendition of "You've lost that loving feeling". Bummer though, it didn't work as well for me as it did for Tom Cruise (maybe I should follow a girl into the bathroom... and if you have no idea what I'm talking about go out and watch Top Gun already).<br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Working hard</span><br /> I've been coding away, doing my small part to help fufill IBM's vision of Activity-Centric Collaboration. So far the only real outward facing part of that collaboration vision is <a title="Activity Explorer" href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ae/">Activity Explorer</a>  and thats what I signed up with IBM to work on ... but<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> lets just say that IBM may have a few more tricks  up its sleeve.  IMHO really <span style="font-style: italic;">very cool</span> stuff going on in my team. Hopefully I'll  actually be able to blog about it some time (and I hope that I'm not overstepping my bounds right now!).<br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thanksgiving Plans</span><br /> So I'm coming back down to the Md/Va area for Thanksgiving. Actually I'm coming down  this Friday and taking the whole week off from work (though I'm sure that I'll connect back up and get some done).  The plan is to bounce around and see if I can visit as many people as possible when I'm down. My plans are  set for the weekend (Karen has already claimed her time :) ) but I'm still figuring out what is going on the other days. I'll of course be with familiy on Thursday (and  probably Wednesday too) but am open to figure what to do on  Monday, Tuesday,  Friday, and possibly Sunday night as well.  So please bug me if there is anything already going on one of those days. I'm hoping to try and fit it a visit to UMD (hail AAers),  some of the other former College Parkers/in and around DCers (would have been sweet if I could have timed this to come down and play frisbee with you guys again), and catch up with the  high school crew (we need a better name than that :) ). Anyway, I'll try and get in touch and see what we can figure out. Feel from to comment some ideas.<br /> <br /> <br /> <font size="1"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm trying out </span><a style="font-style: italic;" title="Writely" href="http://www.writely.com">Writely</a>  <span style="font-style: italic;">to blog this. Very cool, though still a few rough edges.</span></font><a title="Activity Explorer" href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ae/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></a>
