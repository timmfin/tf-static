            <p><em>This is a slightly different post than normal. Below is an IM converstation that I had with my generic and unknown friend other. I thought it was an interesting converstation that shows some of my perspective on music sharing and also shows how much of an uptight and jerk friend I can be :/ .. oh well.</em></p>

<p><em>Also, I didn't even try to fix misspellings and grammatical errors... Rereading what you quickly typed on IM makes you feel dumb.</em></p>

<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: hey<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: another question<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: lol<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: whats up?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: I wanted to check the umm....legalness of a certain downloading program<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: :-D<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: it's called mytunes redux<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: people ahve said to me that it's not illegal<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: it have a site?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: umm..hold on lemme check<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: (legality btw :))<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: lol<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: minimalverbosity.com<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: no www<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: http://minimalverbosity.com/<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: u still there?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: yers<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: yes<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: k<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: so the thing that this application allows is the sharing of music files on the hard drives of other on your network (in your case this is other students)..<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: yes<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: apple's itunes kind of already lets you do this, but it don't let you download the file from the other student. it just lets you play it remotely and not copy it onto your machine<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: okay..<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: but this app will allow you to grabother student's music files, so the application itself it not illegal.... but<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: but?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: no matter how you get a hold of a copyrighted song, if you didn't pay for it and you keep a copy for your own use (not just a one time test or something) you are technically stealing the song<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: but can they catch me?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: like...the government?...orwhoever?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: well... almost anything is possible on the internet so the answer to "can" is yes<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: I got scared cause my internet started acting all screwy today....<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: I'd rather prefer not to discuss the whole "can I get away with it" thing, since you probably won't like what I have to say<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: well...<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: am I going to get in trouble?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: is this whymy internet is being weird?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: I'm sure the two things are totally unrelated<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: really?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: but as for "am I going to get in trouble" .. again, I'd rather prefer not to discuss the whole "can I get away with it" thing, since you probably won't like what I have to say<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: you are having network problems.. if someone was hacking your system to see what files you had you probably wouldn't even notice<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: what do you ahve to say?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: sure you want to ask?<br />

</p>
<p><em>... small tangent ...</em></p>
<p>

<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: but..honestly....can you answer me something...objectively<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: I don't want to encourage you to download copyrighted material, seeing if someone is hacking your machine is another story..<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: whats the question?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: should I take the software off my compture?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: computer<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: well you are not asking an objective question (that question is totally based on personal opinion)..<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: no...<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: because if they're going to come nad slap handcuffs on me tomorrow..then I want it off<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: lol<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: ... but if you can get away with it and forget about the possible legal consequences its ok..<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: huh?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: I'm not asking if it's right<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: I'm asking if I'm going to get in trouble<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: yes you are<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: yes I am what?<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: am I going to get in trouble?  could I possiblyget in trouble?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: well anyone who ever does anything illegal could possibly get it trouble<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: as in if I went 1 mph over the speedlimit I could get a ticket<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: Tim<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: ....<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: then ask a more specific question :)<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: am I goign to get in trouble?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: now you are asking me to predict the future<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: Tim....<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: .. lol<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: please<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: you know what I"m asking<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: .. yes I know, you want me to make you feel safe and tell you that its ok for you to steal music<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: yes<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: (I warned you :))<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: ut oh..what's that supposed to mean?<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: I warned you that I might say something you don't like and or want to hear<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: k<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: go ahead<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: no I think I've already made my point, I'm in no lecture mood today<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: okay..well..that's good..but you stilldidn't answer my question..you just reworded it<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: ok, well I'll honestly refuse to answer the question then<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: :-(<br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: fine<br />
<span class="blue">TimmFin</span>: my reasoning to answer the question are motivated by ethics and yours by consequence.. I don't want to force my opinion on you, so I'm just not going to answer. <br />
<span class="red">&lt;other&gt;</span>: :-(<br />
<span class="red"">&lt;other&gt;</span>: that's all I have to say about that:-(
