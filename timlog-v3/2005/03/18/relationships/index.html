        <div class=post>
            <p>After all these years being single (last time I dated was some in Freshman year, though I tried once as a Sophomore) I think I'm actually missing being in a relationship. I think the majority of college I couldn't really be bothered to want to spend that much time trying to impress/get to know/develop a relationship with someone. I guess I never really had my socks knocked off between then and now...</p>

<p>So I guess, here I am know moving off to place where I know practically no one, still clinging to the shyness of my youth, and I've had less dating experience than the average high schooler. Well maybe these are exaggerations, but still I feel like I don't know the "rules of the game".</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder how much easier life would be if I could just forget about morals, respecting females, and the rest of my overall up tightness. I'd sure have a good time, at least for a little bit... ahh, but that's not really an option for me anyways. I wouldn't even know how to start acting like someone other than myself.</p>

<p>Here's to hoping Boston has plenty of interesting, beautiful, and open-minded women! And two, that I'd actually get the guts to talk to them.</p>

<p><em>Note: I quite rarely talk to anyone except a few people about my personal life, not exactly sure why I'm writing this to a slightly larger audience now. Don't worry. I'm sure it won't happen again for quite some while.</em></p>
