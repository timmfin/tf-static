        <div class=post>
            <p>So some long two weeks ago I was in Boston with <a href="http://spi.panaverse.com/journal/" target="_parent">Steve</a>. Our apartment hunting trip went very well and we decided on an apartment complex called <a href="http://www.bostonapartments.com/legacy.htm" target="_parent">The Legacy</a> in Arlington. If you look <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=438+Massachusetts+Ave,+Arlington+ma&hl=en" target="_parent">here</a> you can see that we are fairly close to the city. The nearest T stop (metro for you DCers) is a quick bike ride away and there is a bus stop right outside our apartment.</p>

<p>I have a few of the pictures I took that weekend <a href="http://timmfin.net/gallery/sp_index.php?dir=./Photographs/Boston/Apartment" target="_parent">here</a>. There are few shots of the complex, a field and pond only about a minute away, and what (downtownish) Arlington looks like right outside of our complex.</p>

<p>In other news, I got to go to my first concert. <a href="http://www.semantichive.com/" target="_parent">Pete</a> was the nice guy who got me the tickets to Lenny Kravitz (somewhat spontaneously, but kind of like a graduation/birthday/farewell present). I was apprehensive at first and was worried that I wouldn't be much of the concert type. Thankfully it was really very enjoyable. I bit loud for my tastes, but I got quite into it when he did Fly Away, American Woman, and <del datetime="2005-05-06T01:31:2904:00">Are you Going to Go my Way</del> Are you Gonna Go My Way. Glad that I got the chance to go, I owe you one Pete</p>
