            I found this today, and I had not blogged in a while (I should talk about my boston trip I had last weekend and all the stuff thats going on.. but I guess I'm a bit busy and lazy for that, Whoops! Maybe sometime next week after I finish my CS project, my 2 review papers, my science fiction story, my photography paper, my OS exam, etc). Anyways, I wish I had done this before, Genius!

<blockquote>Hal 2000

For a computer programming class, I sat directly across from someone and our computers were facing away from each other. A few minutes into the class, she got up to leave the room. I reached between our computers and switched the inputs for the keyboards. She came back and started typing and immediately got a distressed look on her face. She called the teacher over and explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen. The teacher tried everything. By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking red-faced.

I started to type, "Leave me alone!"

They both jumped back, silenced. "What the... " the teacher said.

I typed, "I said leave me alone!"

The kid got real upset. "I didn't do anything to it, I swear!"

It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud. The conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes.

Me: "Don't touch me!"

Her: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit your keys that hard."

Me: "Who do you think you are anyway?!" Etc.

Finally, I couldn't contain myself any longer and fell out of my chair laughing. After they had realised what I had done, they both turned beet red. Funny, I never got more than a C- in that class.
