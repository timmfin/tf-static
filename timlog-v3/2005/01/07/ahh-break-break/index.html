            Hmm, no school for another two weeks, few obligations, plently of time... shouldn't I think that that is wonderful? I think I do think that, but only superficially. Actually I'm quite worried about myself at times like this since - well - I can be horribly lazy.

Its something that I don't totally understand either. Whenever I have some motivation, even if it some small or distant motivation, I will always get the job done, project completed, mind prepared, see it through, whatever it is (yea, please take that with a grain of salt. I'm leaving out all the small "I'm not perfect, but tend to be like this" qualifications for brevity's sake. But then I just wasted the past few sentences, and in a parenthesis for that matter! Oh well...)

The problem is that right now, I've been very blessed. My future (career-wise at least) is stable (well for an undergrad not working yet) and looks bright. So, what am I supposed to be worrying about right now? Finding work, <i>check</i>; paying the rent, <i>check</i>; figuring out where to go out on Friday night, <i>well that's not quite my thing so.. check</i>; getting a girlfriend? <i>hmm, should I be worrying about this? I think not, if it happens it happens. And you certainly are not going to see me turn in into a smooth, extroverted, seeking-bachelor anytime soon</i>...

Ok back to my point (I have a way of rambling in these posts. I guess that happens when you are writing without much purpose). I don't feel compelled to do anything at all right now. Sure I could do this, or I could do that, but I seem to think more about what I could be doing then what I actually am doing. Eventually after thinking too much about how I could be more productive (by productive I mean still having fun while doing something with some sort of worthwhile basis. Currently some examples are programming (it is what I want to do for a living), creating more artwork (I always like doing it, but I never actually do any in my free time), and spending more time with friends, especially those that I don't give enough time to or have not seen in a while (I'm kinda prone in keeping relationships one sided and not giving my fair share of effort)).

So you see, what I end up doing is realizing that I should be doing something else and yet I still chose the option with the best ratio of pleasure received over effort required. Why am I worried about efficiency when I have no time to worry about? Good question, maybe I just tend to think that way, maybe I'm really using the previous statement as an excuse, maybe ... well, the latter is probably correct.

And so, to do something about this. Its seems that the act of writing this was a start. But the question is, am I seeking others to think about me this way? I'm I writing this because I want others to read it and think about this, so I can set them up to think better of me? Well, I don't think that I am, but I'd have to say that I wouldn't be surprised if my subconscious has done/considered doing that before ("subconscious considering" Geeze now that's an oxymoron I've never heard).

Enough, sometimes I'm lazy. Sometimes I'm not. I wish I were not, but I cannot ignore/excuse either side.

Conclusion. Since I know I can be lazy, act in a manner knowing that I could seek the lazy solution. Thinking about planning ahead for how I plan ahead? How do I do that? Not sure, but at least its a rationalization that I don't feel badly about... for now.
