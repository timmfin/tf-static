        <div class=post>
            <p>It is a bit late to post a full review (yes, I went to the midnight showing), but I have to say that I'm impressed. After the first prequel most thought that Star Wars was lost, becoming more of a money machine than an engaging and fun story. Although <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> had some faults, it is far more good than bad. This wasn't a movie that made you run out of the theaters thinking that you saw the greatest movie of all time, but it was powerful. I finally felt connected to the Star Wars characters like I did in the orginial movies. The dark emotions in the film hit me pretty deep, even though I knew the what events were going to happen.</p>

<p>So all you Star Wars fans, go out and see the concluding/connecting chapter. I hope that you forget the critical nitpicking you have become habituated to and really enjoy the movie.</p>
