        <div class=post>
            I've been busy the past few weeks either by preparing, doing, or recovering from the ski trips I went on the past two weekends. The first one was to Wisp, down in Deep Creek Maryland. But why did I go down south to ski? Well, I got an offer last minute from a friend (Karen) ... and who can turn down a ski trip? We lucked out and the conditions were great. About 6 inches of fresh snow on arrival, and it snowed the entire weekend. Karen and I actually managed to make it through the weekend without killing each other (but that all fell through a few days after the trip). The only problem with the Wisp trip was my total utter failure doing 360s (which I've just started to get the hang of this year). Oh boy those mishaps (aka complete crash landings) left a mark -- but fortunately all bones still intact. And how can I not mention the hot tub snow angels? Good times.

I came back late Monday night  (in fact catching the last red line T home) to try and rush together things for v-day. Fortunately, I had at least planned a bit ahead and gotten reservations the week prior, but there were plenty of other little things to get done (clean!). Reservations were at 9:00pm at Flora in Arlington but that's the best I could scrape up -- I didn't know how crazy the city gets on Valentines, next time I'll know that you have to plan that wayyy ahead of time. The dinner was a bit more elegant than I'm used to, but still good. Overall, I think it went well and I even got some homemade cookies. Thanks Cindy :)

This past weekend I was in Killington with the fam. Its funny to say that the conditions in Maryland were better than Vermont (I've yet to have good conditions skiing in NE). At least Killington has pretty good snow making so the mornings were ok, but in the afternoon the slopes were practically solid ice. It wasn't horrible though, and we managed to still have a good time and do all the typical family bonding (aka ragging on each other constantly). I was a bit more reserved this trip, especially after I bruised my other hip falling off a box when boarding. I told myself that was all the extreme I needed for the trip... but I couldn't prevent myself the next day on my ski boards. I managed to stay away from the rails and any special trips and stuck to seeing how far I could fly through the air. That one gigantic jump at the bottom of bear mountain was just too tempting :). I managed to get the courage  to go off of it twice and I actually cleared the table top on the second try. I wish I could have gotten a picture of that, I must have been 10-15 feet in the air and cleared 15-20 feet on the ground. Now that's a thrill.

So now I'm again recovering. Soccer was painful last week, but tonight... owch. I definitely was diving much less on my left side than I should have. And we ended with a tie... I so shouldn't have let a couple of those goals in :(. Hopefully I won't still have black and blue hips next week. So worth it though!
