        <div class=post>
            This weekend I took Cindy to see <a title="Spam-a-lot" href="http://www.montypythonsspamalot.com/">Spam-a-lot</a> (for her birthday). I was a bit worried that it would be a bit too crude-and-corny-and-not-really-a-musical, but I was wrong :). The show was incredibly funny and actually more muscial-ish than I expected (though the singing couldn't come close to those other "real" shows). I guess it didn't win the 2005 Tony Award for nothing.

Going into the show I was looking forward to seeing my favorite parts of the movie* - scenes with the Knights of Ni, "Bring out yer dead", and the Black Knight. All were in the show with some sort of modification. I wasn't quite ready for the bring out yer dead shtick to become an upbeat dance tune (though I have to admit it was catchy). The Black night was still as gruesome as ever (I've still got me teeth!). Though the best by far was the Knights of Ni who became "the Knights who say Icci, Icci, bootang, Zoip ... Its hard out here to be a pimp.. (rhythm and rapping for a few minutes) ... for shizzle". We were rolling in our seats :). Fun times.

I'll be flying over to Cincinatti this weekend to see the Reds opening day with my baseball-fanatic-girlfriend (her hometown). Oh, and the president will be there (he must have heard I was going) :)

* There are too many other good parts to try and limit myself to just a few good ones. The show still had the self-affacing monks, the rabbit with big claws (like this), the holy hand-grenade (five is right out!), and many others. I did miss the "What is your favorite color?" though.
