  "post_content": "![41048549][small][] Ah, yet another few weeks of no update despite all the times I've told myself, \"Ya know, that would be something good to blog about.\" To help fix this, I'm going to try to force myself to post something everyday. No, not because I think that I need to publicly express myself <strong>that</strong> much, but rather to force myself to actually try and write something. I don't care whether I post a single link or single sentence (maybe I should do something more than just a word though).\r\n\r\nI think my problem of desiring to write yet somehow never getting around to it is rooted in my wonderfully helpful/inconvenient  perfectionism. With every good idea comes to guilt of taking the time to do it justice. So lets cut the crap and see how it goes.\r\n\r\nAnother idea, to play around with <a href=\"http://writeboard.com\">Writeboard</a>, try a somewhat collaborative \"blogstorming\", give myself a head start, and keep myself accountable I've created a <a href=\"https://123.writeboard.com/6b29f20901b323d36\">blog ideas writeboard</a>. Feel free to check it out, insert suggestions, and do whatever with it. The password is timmfin (and tell me if you have problems with it!).",
