  "post_content": "I never saw the movie, but Pete and I just made our 10 hour trek to White Castle… Well, really  we are just 10 hours into the trip (just entering Indianapolis now) and couldn't decide where to stop for a bite to eat.\r\n\r\nSo, nothing exciting too far. We'll see how far into the night we can drive tonight. Maybe we can get to Missouri sometime in the middle of the night, take a brief rest and get out to Colorado by tomorrow night :)… (trying to use the road trip enthusiasm while it still lasts)\r\n",
