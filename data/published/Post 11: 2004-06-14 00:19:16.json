  "post_content": "I just got back from a good weekend back in Maryland. Most importantly my Mom is doing very well after her surgery, but we knew that would happen. She always comes back strong :). If you are interested in sending and/or contacting her in the hospital drop me an email and I'll get you the info.\r\n\r\nIn other news, congratulations to the newly wed Christian and Erin Conti-Vock! Glad to be able to be at the wedding (even though I was a tad late... shhh).  I had a great time making a fool of myself on the dance floor. I'm suprised that I remembered some of those line dances and swing. I need to dance more often, I didn't remember how much fun it can be.",
