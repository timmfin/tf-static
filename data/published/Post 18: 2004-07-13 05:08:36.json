  "post_content": "Lets just say that tonight was my night. I won, but I should have gone out so many times. I probably was all in 5 times... whew. When the table was down to only three players I was by far the short-stack of the group (around 1/6 the chips of the leader). Lady luck must have been sitting on my shoulder since I quickly doubled, doubled again, then <em>tripled</em> myself  to the first place position.\r\n\r\nI should calm down. I have used $20 so far (including tonight) to play poker this summer, and with a fresh dose of two twenties I'm up again. If I lose all the rest of the summer poker games I'll be braking even.  Atleast thats me trying to rationalize the fact that I was gambling. Just $5 doesn't seem like gambling, but it sure does seem so when 13 people are playing.",
