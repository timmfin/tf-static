  "post_content": "Christmas was good as always, and as always my parents gave me more than I deserve (still be spoiled at 21?). The biggest tradition my family has for Christmas is putting up and decorating the tree on Christmas Eve. Its once of those nice, sappy family moments remincing old times from our childhood. :) The tree this year (which we got for real cheap on the 23rd) was pretty big, we had to use a ladder to decorate the top. In one of the pictures you can see my brother using it to put on tinsel, for which my Dad would say, \"Only one strand at a time!\" But we've known for years that none of us ever really do that.",
