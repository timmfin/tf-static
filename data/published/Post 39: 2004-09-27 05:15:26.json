  "post_content": "I didn't update about the last game we played, oh well. I think we won that one.\r\n\r\nAnother win today (3-1), but for the third time now, the team we played was down a player (at least for part of the game). This makes me nervous for the playoffs since I don't think we've played at full intensity yet. I guess the good thing is that I got to mess around as goalie. I got the chance to dribble up the field and take a shot twice... One of these days I'll learn to hit the goal :). I'd like to take some pictures of soccer, but ya know, I'm playing so thats not quite possible.\r\n\r\nThe other things in life (yes I do more than soccer) are going well, maybe too well.  All of my classes are intriguing, I haven't had too much work to do (insert random senior schedule comment), apartment life has been good (though I do miss the AA'ers), and things have been shaping up nicely for post-graduation (the <em>real</em> world)... A little light on the details there, I may have more to say some time in the next month or so.",
