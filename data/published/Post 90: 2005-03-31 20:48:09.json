He's a cool guy (and he thinks too much, even more than I tend to do sometimes) so if you'd like to hear what he has to say until he gets his own webspace, check out <a href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/chris\" target=\"_parent\">Chris's Blog</a>. <em>Note: He is calling himself a philosophical madman, so don't say I didn't warn you</em> :).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other news I've actually spent some time trying to work on the new site layout. I'm not done yet, but getting close.</p>",
