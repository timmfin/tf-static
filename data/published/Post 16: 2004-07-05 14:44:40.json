  "post_content": "I haven't been excited  for Independence Day since I was a kid, but people in Boston are quite different.  I first suspected something when I heard people talking about July 4th more than a month and a half early.  Everyone was getting excited and for good reason. Yesterday (actually the whole weekend) there were tons of things going on. Free concerts (Boston Pops), events, patriotic sing-a-longs, and of course fireworks. Wow, those were darn impressive fireworks. Its been a while since I've seen serious fireworks (last time was 3-4 years ago in DC), so I don't know if it mostly because of improvements in firework technology or if Boston's show if just 10 times better than anyone else's. I guess that hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hours to see a 30 min show, can't be wrong. I'll see if any of the pictures I took with my shiny new digital camera came out.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Extreme Blue/July 4 - Boston 1.jpeg\"><img src=\"/gallery/cache/a24c20d8549cc5ebb71a5cd5ac9ed1b5.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><span>July 4 - Boston 1.jpeg</span></a></div>\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Extreme Blue/July 4 - Boston 2.jpeg\"><img src=\"/gallery/cache/ef033c21268ba99d8f045841d519d7b9.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><span>July 4 - Boston 2.jpeg</span></a></div>\r\n\t<div class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Extreme Blue/July 4 - Boston 3.jpeg\"><img src=\"/gallery/cache/28e70e15c98c77c41840b8782b5998d8.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><span>July 4 - Boston 3.jpeg</span></a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\r\n",
