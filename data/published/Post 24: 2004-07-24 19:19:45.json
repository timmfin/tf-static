Fortunately, I got the chance to go to a game through work. I might be very busy, but who can turn down a free ballgame ticket?\r\n\r\nThe socks were playing the Baltimore Orioles, my hometown team. I haven't been following the O's for some time, so I didn't wear the O's orange and black. But when we started winning, I made sure to give the Boston native interns a hard time :).\r\n\r\n<div class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Extreme Blue/Fenway Park 2.jpeg\"><img src=\"/gallery/cache/15e9f5cb6ccb54c8a7b24d2f2659473e.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><span>Fenway Park 2.jpeg</span></a></div>\r\n\t<div class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Extreme Blue/July 4 - Boston 1.jpeg\"><img src=\"/gallery/cache/a24c20d8549cc5ebb71a5cd5ac9ed1b5.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><span>July 4 - Boston 1.jpeg</span></a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\r\n\r\n\t",
