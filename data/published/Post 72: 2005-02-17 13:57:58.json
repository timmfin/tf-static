  "post_content": "<p>Lol, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/kidtalk.mspx\">Microsoft has made a page</a> to help parents understand '13375p34k' (leetspeak) so they can understand what their hacker kids are doing. I think its so hilarious to have such a serious analysis of such an utterly dorky thing. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Rules of grammar are rarely obeyed. Many leetspeekers will capitalize every letter except for vowels (LiKe THiS) and otherwise reject conventional English style and grammar.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well that one's pretty obvious... :)</p>\r\n\r\n<em>Seems like the link isn't working for now... hmmm. Go <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/default.mspx\">here</a> and click on \"Learn online slang to ...\"</em>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, I <a href=\"http://c133.org/blog/tech/google_dinner_beta.html\">heard a rumor</a> that Google is starting to offer Batman positions. I'd better get my superhero resume together :).</p>",
