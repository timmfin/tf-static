  "post_content": "Ahh, rest... I had a nice day of doing very little. I'm in Weber (about 10 miles away from Rochester NY) right now, in the apartment complex made dad is staying at. Today we (including my grandparents since they are visiting here as well) toured around Rochester a bit, seeing a bit of the historical district and High Falls. It was a tad suprising, but Rochester seems (to be frank) old and dilapidated. True, I only saw part of it, but I just wasn't seeing many modern building, rather old, broken, and rusted ones. (Next time I'll just have to bring my camera along to show photographic evidence)\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm just spoiled that the cities I'm used too, namely Boston and DC, are bigger, more populated, and generally nicer. I'm not much of a city fan any way, so I'm no judge.\r\n\r\nI'll be heading back home (well not really home, since there is no home in Maryland anymore) tomorrow. The drive from Boston to here was a bit slow, hopefully this one is better eventhough is longer.",
