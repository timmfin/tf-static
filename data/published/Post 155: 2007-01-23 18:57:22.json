  "post_content": "Whew, Lotusphere is pretty big, bigger than I expected. Seeing 6000+ people in one room makes you realize that 6000 is a lot of people. I'm having a great time here so far and we are getting pretty good feedback from customers.\r\n\r\n... wait, let me step back a second. I have been working on Activities for Lotus the past year and a half. That started with Activities Explorer, then moved on to having an Activities web interface, and now we're in <a href=\"http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product3.nsf/wdocs/connections\">Lotus Connections</a> (formerly Ventura). It has been very exciting to work on Social Software, I can finally tell my friends that I'm hip and work on cool <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_software\">social networking</a> software (instead of just some longer description about enterprise collaboration).\r\n\r\nAfter a few small snafus on our part, it seems like Lotusphere attendees are starting to log in and try out our free test of Lotus Connections. Hopefully the word will spread and will get more exposure -- we're really hoping to get feedback that we can work into our product!\r\n\r\nSome related links:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.elsua.net/2006/12/01/ibm-lotus-ventura-ibms-take-of-social-software-within-the-enterprise-2/\">http://www.elsua.net/2006/12/01/ibm-lotus-ventura-ibms-take-of-social-software-within-the-enterprise-2/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.kintya.com/blog/2007/01/ibm_validates_e.html\">http://www.kintya.com/blog/2007/01/ibm_validates_e.html</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3655391\">internetnews.com</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2086145,00.asp\">PC Magizine</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=590\">http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=590</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.assodigitale.it/content/view/3578/31/\">http://www.assodigitale.it/content/view/3578/31/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2173209/ibm-revamps-lotus-offerings\">http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2173209/ibm-revamps-lotus-offerings</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/21/business/ibm.php\">http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/21/business/ibm.php</a></li>\r\n</ul>",
