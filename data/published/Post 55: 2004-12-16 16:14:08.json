  "post_content": "I hung out with Karen yesterday going out to the mall to start my Christmas shopping (well, and to find something me too). I don't think I can buy too many gifts yet since I will be flying up to my parent's new place in New York.  Thats a good enough excuse for me to do last minute shopping :).\r\n\r\nWe also went to see <em>Ocean's 12</em>. Neither of us knew that it was out already, it must have premiered last week sometime. I though <em>Ocean's 11</em> was great  and was excited about the sequel, but I didn't think that the sequel would be anything good. Fortunately, I was wrong. I'm not sure if the second movie topped the first, but I think it came pretty close. I'd like to say more but I don't want to give anything away, go out and see it!",
