  "post_content": "So only one more semester to go and then I'm out into the real world. Scary stuff... well not really. I'm certainly not eager to move on to career life, but nor eager to finish being a student either. Both have ups and downs, but it certainly seems like it is time to move on whether it be for better or worse.\r\n\r\nI can now say that two of my classes are offically done. Yesterday I performed my vocal solo and today turned in my take home final today to finish up Beginning Voice. Also today I handed in my final sculpture for my Wood class. \r\n\r\nI'm going on a retreat this weekend which should be fun, but it's not the best timing since I have a final on Moday and Tuesday. Not too big of a deal though, I'm sure that I'll have plenty of time to study Friday day and Sunday night if I make myself productive.",
