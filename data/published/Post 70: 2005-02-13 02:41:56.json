If I have to thank Duke for one thing, it would be that them losing gave me some good riot material to photograph :).\n\nMaryland, its time to pick it up for the end of the year. Please no more losses like the Miami and Clemson ones. If only they'd play at full potential all the time...\n\nGO TERPS!",
