  "post_content": "Computers and technology often seem to be inherently different than the arts, but is there really such a great divide between the two? Here is a paper I wrote begins to address this question. It looks at programming in comparison to writing, programming languages in comparison to languages, and computer code in comparison to literature.\r\n\r\nThis paper turned out to be a bit more than a typical class project since I was quite inspired by some of the ideas found while researching the topic. So please take a look at it, especially if you are a techie who thinks the code they write is more than just a a block of computer instructions, or if you are a complete non-techie who doesn't understand how programming can be quite a creative and artistic task.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/doc/tim-finley-programming-as-literature.doc\">MS Word</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/doc/tim-finley-programming-as-literature.sxw\">Open Office (free office alternative, you should try it out)</a>",
