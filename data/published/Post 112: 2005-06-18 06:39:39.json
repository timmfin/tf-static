Please don't read them too closely, they haven't really been edited and were sort of just thrown together :).  They still serve the purpose nonetheless.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm sitting in the laundry room of the KOA campground near Grand Teton Natl. park. The campground offers free wireless internet so we're all set with Pete's laptop. Anyways, it may be some time until I get some pictures up since I've already taken over 500 of them (and I still have lots of things to see). Time to let Pete use the computer for a bit, cya!",
