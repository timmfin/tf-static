  "post_content": "<a href=\"http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/000481.html\">Interesting read</a> for all you open source folks (the whole one or two of them that read my blog). Its about the problems of \"fundamentalist\" open source zealots (RMS and the crew comes to mind). If you don't know who RMS is and don't know what the GPL is then don't even try reading it, it will make no sense whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWhy do people have to believe things so literally? Isn't it obvious that fundamentalism for any type of belief (religion, politics, etc) leads to overconfidence, then superiority, next prejudice, and eventually hatred? \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nWhy can't we all just get along? :|",
