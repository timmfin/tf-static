  "post_content": "So its finally time to take my leave back to good ole' MD. I've had quite a time here in Boston, and I'm quite attracted to come back some time, but for now I'd rather not have to worry about more career choices (although I do need to be making some important decisions soon).  \r\n\r\n\r\nI should take the time to write out more of my thoughts about this summer. It certainly has been one to remember. Well, thats for another time though. I need to pack and get ready to move out. Another thing is that my car, which hasn't moved one inch since I drove to Boston, has a dead battery.  I can look forward to trying to get someone from the gas station to give me a jump nice and early in the morning. ",
