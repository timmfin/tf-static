  "post_content": "So another semester begins. I'm now living in South Campus Commons #5, a bit different than the good 'ole Anne Arundel dorms. I know that I'll miss the kind of social atmosphere you get living on a great dorm hall, but I think its time to move on so I can cook (goodbye dinning hall), have my own room, and have more space to put all my stuff (kudzu... inside joke to previous roommates).\r\n\r\nBelow are two hastily taken pictures of my half moved in. You can see that I made sure to have my entertainment already set up, since my tv (I just bought it yesterday), DDR (yes, yes I'm addicted to Dance Dance Revolution for those who don't already know), and my computer are all ready to go. :)\r\n\r\n",
