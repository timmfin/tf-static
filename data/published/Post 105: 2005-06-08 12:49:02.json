That link directs you to a Dell offer of $750 off of a laptop purchase of $1500 or more. Seriously, pretty much cutting the cost in half. I would probably buy one myself, but its likely that I will have a work laptop and I don't think that I'll need to have two of them. You'd better hurry on the offer though, it only works for the first 15000 items sold, which will probably only be within a few hours.",
