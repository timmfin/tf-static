  "post_content": "So I'm all settled in Cambridge, Ma now. I had fun this weekend, checked out Boston a bit, made and ate off a grill out of rocks and a microwave rack, and bowled some. I'm starting to get to know the other interns now, seems like this will be a fun summer. It also seems that I will be working quite a bit, probably averaging 50hrs a week and maybe more near the end of the summer. I hope the project is interesting!",
