  "post_content": "So there goes another $5. I never let myself play any poker games before and maybe I should  have kept that up.   Though, I do have to say that it is fun to play. I kept on telling myself that I will win one of these days and it will all even out (Central Limit Theorm right?). Someone helped me rationalize the $5 weekly poker fee (more like a tax currently) when they said it was cheaper than going to a movie. Actually it only half a movie ticket, so I do consider the few hours of fun from it pretty worthwhile.\r\n\r\nI'll keep posting how I do. We'll see if I get any better over the summer and stop getting pushed around by those MIT students. 6/28 - 6th place out of 10.",
