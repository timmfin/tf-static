  "post_content": "Everything is better now, but I had drastic computer problems over the weekend.  <em>Note: Dorkiness ahead, read at your own risk.</em>\r\n\r\nWhenever my Linux box starts crashing, I really know that there are problems. After a few frustrating days, I figured out that the fan on my video card was dying. It would spin up for a few seconds and then stop causing the chip to overheat whenever it was given a decent load.\r\n\r\nSo the first thing I tried to do (of course) was take the card out and try to take apart and fix the fan. That didn't work, so I ripped the old fan out and made a makeshift replacement with another fan from inside my case (yeah for zip ties, look at the picture). So I ended end with a pretty ghetto-looking video card, but hey it works.\r\n\r\nOh and to top that all off, in the process of fixing/troubleshooting I really screwed over my system files. It doesn't help that   my older hard drives are going really flaky now, I have had quite a few problems with corrupted data. I don't think I had to do a complete reinstall, but it seemed that it was a good time.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Projects/ghetto-videocard-0001.jpg\"><img src=\"/gallery/sp_getthumb.php?source=Photographs/Projects/ghetto-videocard-0001.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><span>ghetto-videocard-0001.jpg</span></a></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\r\n",
