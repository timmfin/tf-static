  "post_content": "This past weekend I flew on over to Cincinnati (with a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/123536575/in/set-72057594099187960/\">long layover</a> in Detroit) to see the Red's opening day with Cindy. Here's the short version of the trip. (A few pictures are below, more are on <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin/sets/72057594099187960/\">flickr</a>).\r\n<a title=\"Cindy the (ultimate) Reds fan\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/123538797\"><img width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Cindy the (ultimate) Reds fan\" class=\"flickrwrapper\" style=\"float: none\" src=\"http://static.flickr.com/36/123538797_a7b603dac1_m.jpg\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Friday:</strong> flight, crazy thunderstorm and delay, flight, picked up by Kelly and Paul, Skyline at 2:00am, dog #1 (Bailey).\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Me as a Reds fan\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/123538516\"><img width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Me as a Reds fan\" class=\"flickrwrapper\" style=\"float: none\" src=\"http://static.flickr.com/34/123538516_36b97c5ae8_m.jpg\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Saturday:</strong> Dog #2 (Cody), met Heather, Keith, Jonathan and dog #3 (Lucy), pizza (9 pieces or so) and met lots more of Cindy's family, hanging with Kevin, Melissa, and dog #4 (Emma), out to a bar for the final 4 games (boring games!), 2nd place in Texas hold'em, lost in foosball, lost in air hockey (just barely).\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Kevin with a to-go cup\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/123537606\"><img width=\"160\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Kevin with a to-go cup\" class=\"flickrwrapper\" style=\"float: none\" src=\"http://static.flickr.com/41/123537606_3e6aa9e4c1_m.jpg\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sunday:</strong>over to Cindy's Mom's place, met more family and dogs #5 and #6 (no idea with spelling), guitar hero, avoiding getting in any of the Banzhaf photoshoot (successful), played my first game of Cornhole (think bean-bag horseshoes), food, making a good impression/fool of myself with DDR in front of Cindy's family (I did beat her brother though), off to the city, picked up a Red's hat (last pic below), picked up some Graeter's ice cream (good stuff!), visited Cindy's grandma, visited Devou park, errands in and around Cincinnati, leftover pizza.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Cindy and Tim at the Greak American Ball Park\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/123536330\"><img width=\"240\" height=\"228\" alt=\"Cindy and Tim at the Greak American Ball Park\" class=\"flickrwrapper\" style=\"float: none\" src=\"http://static.flickr.com/37/123536330_62a13d130f_m.jpg\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Monday:</strong> preperation for the game, picked up Sammy at UC, touring the Cincinnati ghetto, Skyline and beer at 10:30 (yea, 10:30am), beer poured into to-go cups for the parade (modeled by Kevin with the green finger above), off to the ballpark, peanuts outside the park (a necessity), standing room only tickets (start to get cold), president throws out the first pitch, gave up 5 runs in the first, still cold, hotdog,standing tickets turn into <em>real</em> seats (a little less cold), tied it back up, give up 7 runs in the 6th (and most people start to leave), check out another view of the stadium (from standing room, to 10th row seats, to first row seats), Reds lose. Out to dinner, back to Cindy's sister's place, catch a bit of the NCAA final (still not exciting), early bed.\r\n<strong>Tuesday:</strong> Up quite early and off to the airport.. and the rest is boring",
