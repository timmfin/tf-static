  "post_content": "Had my first intramural soccer game today. Came away with a victory 5-2, but I don't think we can say too much since the other team was missing a player.  The astro turf fields at school were just redone and now they are some type of \"field turf\". Its pretty interesting, imagine about 2 inch plastic grass blades in layer of granular rubber (about 1/2 inch or so).\r\n\r\nThings have been slow around here, I guess I have not had much motivation to write about the regular school routine. I'm sure I'll think of something to say sooner or later though.",
