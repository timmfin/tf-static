  "post_content": "Just got back from the night out tonight, 5:30am ... whew! We (Chris, Cory, Terumi, and myself) met up with Laura in Baltimore to do some clubbin'. We first met at Sonar, but we didn't quite fit in there (and didn't agree with the music choices) so we headed to Baja (sp?) after that. Had a much better time there.\r\n\r\nThis clubbing experience was much different and better :) than the one I posted about this <a href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/index.php?p=23\">summer</a>. Dancing is so fun (yea I'm a guy and I like to dance, I admit it). When you don't have to worry about watching and (practically) stalking girls on the dance floor things are so much better.\r\n\r\nAfter closing, we hung out at Laura's homey apartment. It turned out to be a fun (though late) night :)\r\n\r\n<em>The pictures I added were not from that night in Baltimore, but when I was in OC with the same people.</em>",
