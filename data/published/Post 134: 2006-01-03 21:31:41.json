I'll again say that I'm no longer proud to be an American (that reaction wasn't caused by this article, I've held that opinion for some time).<br /> <br /> Now I shouldn't be too negative since America can and still does great things, but I think we could do so much more. Maybe it would be best for us to stop telling the world what they need and to start helping it genuinely (aka, honest care and support... even asking how to help). Is it too much to hope for a honest and caring politician?<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font size=\"1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\">Forwarded to me by</span></font></span><font style=\"font-style: italic;\" size=\"1\"><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"> </span></font><font size=\"1\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" title=\"Steve\" href=\"http://spilog.org\">Steve</a></font>",
