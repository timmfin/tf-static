  "post_content": "<p>Wow <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/microsoft.html\" target=\"_parent\">this fictional account of Linus Torvalds working at Microsoft</a> was funny, very funny (but if you are not a techie it will probably be confusing and boring). It provides humor, baseless speculation, and snide commentary to Microsoft all in one nice package. Nice! My favorite part, <ul><em>You never made me alter my goal, which was world domination for Linux. I'll never forget your line: \"Come on, Linus, infect the mothership.\" I still believe that was the best recruiting pitch ever uttered.</em></ul></p>",
