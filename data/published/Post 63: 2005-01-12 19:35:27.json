  "post_content": "<p>I've done another semi-marathon reading to finish the next book in the <i>Ender's Game</i> shadow series, <i>Shadow Puppets</i>. I'd have to say that this one was not as near as gripping and intense as the others, but it may have made this up by deepening emotionally and spiritually. We're not dealing with kinds anymore (I'm not saying that the prior stories were superficial, but that the further a story goes the more it must deepen in order to be interesting and believable).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good stuff. Though, I'm thinking that I need to read a bad book soon to make sure that I'm not gullible and just liking any story which is at least slightly convincing.</p>",
