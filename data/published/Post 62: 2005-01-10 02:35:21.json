  "post_content": "I spent some more time with friends from high school tonight having good clean bowling fun :). It was (more or less) the same group I hung out with in Ocean City  at New Years (oh I never blogged about that, whoops). It is so interesting how we interact now vs how we were in high school. I'm starting to think that I'm only really getting to know them now, even though we have seen each other much less. But, have long deep and philosophical conversations with others probably tends to make you understand them more.\n\nI'm glad to have known those guys, I should keep in touch with them more.",
