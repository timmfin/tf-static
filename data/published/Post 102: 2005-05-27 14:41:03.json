  "post_content": "Well, if you are looking at this (not in an RSS feed) you porbably have noticed that things have changed to something new (finally). Its really not complete and there are still many small fixes and bugs. The biggest of which is how small pages (like the <a href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/?page_id=75\">artwork</a> page) break in Internet Explorer. I've only really tested the site with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org\">Firefox</a> (if you don't know what this is, go and try it!) and IE 6. If any of you are using other browsers (especially the Mac/Safari crowd), please look around and tell me if anything looks wrong/funny.",
