I arrived in Sunday and did the typical staff busy work. I had a pretty normal day except for the 48oz steak at dinner last night :). Time to listen to the Opening General Session speech - I think there are going to be some pretty cool announcements!\r\n\r\nWho knew that Neil Armstrong was a funny guy?",
