  "post_content": "So today I got the chance to write the following:\r\n\r\nI am excited and enthused to formally accept IBM's employment offer as a\r\nSoftware Engineer...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt felt so weird to write those words, actually writing them was fine but pressing the send button was the hard thing. I literally had my mouse sitting on the send button for several minutes. Waiting for what? I don't exactly know, but I can guess it is a mix of excitement, shock, fear, and thankfulness.\r\n\r\nLike the title says, here now is \"the beginning of the rest of my life\". A lot of words which don't make much sense , but they do indicate the feeling that I have at a turning point in my life. Anytime you step out into a new place, even if you you are looking forward to it (even highly so), it causes worry. A little bit of fear is always a part of change, but this is a good thing. I will never be able to perform my best at IBM if I'm not scared of not doing well enough.\r\n\r\nHere's to a good start, hoping for the best for me and for IBM.\r\n\r\n",
