The story of how I got this car and how I could afford it is a bit long, but suffice it to say that its something to do with my parents thanking me for tuition that I made them not have to pay (thats a mouthful).\r\n\r\nThe pictures here are not that great, but there all I have for now. I'll take some better ones soon.\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"><a href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Car/tsx-new-0001.jpg\"><img src=\"/gallery/sp_getthumb.php?source=Photographs/Car/tsx-new-0001.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><span>tsx-new-0002.jpg</span></a></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>",
