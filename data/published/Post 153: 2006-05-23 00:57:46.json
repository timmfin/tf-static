  "post_content": "It's good to feel (mostly) normal again. That was one heck of an ordeal... but 2 ER visits, 3 doctor's visits, 3 prescriptions, and 2 weeks later I'm back on my feet. Unfortunately, I still don't have all my energy back and can't play any contact sports for another month and a half (for me any sport involving other people... or the ground, is a contact sport).\r\n\r\nI've actually been working at home the past week, but I went into the office for the first time in nearly 3 weeks today. It's funny how quickly things change... last week when I just started working again I found out that my technical lead (<a title=\"Sami Shalabi\" href=\"http://samishalabi.blogspot.com/\">Sami Shalabi</a>) was leaving IBM. Bummer. Major bummer. Sami is a great guy, amazing programmer, and was a blast to work with and learn from. I certainly wish the best for Sami and I  can't thank him enough for all the experience I gained working side by side with him for the past nine months.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone that talked, called, IMed, sent me a card, or visited. I definitely appreciate it.\r\n\r\nHere's a picture of what I missed at the baseball game I was supposed to go to on my birthday. Thanks Cindy, sorry I had to miss it.\r\n\r\n![151671905][small][]",
