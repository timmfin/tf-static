I was cracking up till the last few frames when I noticed that this guy was serious! ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its important to note that this was written in the 80's but he \"revisited\" the topic <a href=\"http://www.chick.com/articles/frpg.asp\">here</a> in 1996. I bet this guy would have a field day with my past history with fantasy tabletop and video games. Satanic warfare? ... umm, its just a game that I had fun playing. It'd be my guess that the author also thinks that reading Harry Potter is a Christian no-no..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, maybe there are people who took D&D over the edge into <em>instant and psychotic behavior</em> but those people had problems before playing a stupid game. This is the same mentality used to say that video games make kids more violent. Will people (*cough*parents*cough*) ever realize that pointing fingers to blame something else just does not work. <strong>Ever.</strong> They should be pointing at themselves (or everyone in society as a whole, I'll agree that parenting is only part of the problem and sometimes the problem is totally unrelated to parenting). Arrrgg.... </p>",
