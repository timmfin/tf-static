I first suspected something when I heard people talking about July 4th more than a month and a half early.  Everyone was getting excited and for good reason. Yesterday (actually the whole weekend) there were tons of things going on. Free concerts (Boston Pops), events, patriotic sing-a-longs, and of course fireworks. Wow, those were darn impressive fireworks. Its been a while since I've seen serious fireworks (last time was 3-4 years ago in DC), so I don't know if it mostly because of improvements in firework technology or if Boston's show if just 10 times better than anyone else's. I guess that hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hours to see a 30 min show, can't be wrong.

I was at Avalon tonight with the EB interns for thursday college night (there are still a few interns here that are not over 21). I had pictured clubbing as being \u003cem\u003eatleast somewhat similar\u003c/em\u003e to my prior dancing experineces (high school, weddings, ...) but that is certainly not the case. My impression of clubbing is the following. Girls go out on the floor by themselves, in their girl-huddles. Guys go up to a girl, grab them, and proceed to \"grind\", basically performing primitive pelvis shaking motions in close quarters.  So for a guy like me who would rather dance with someone and not act like I'm having sex with a stranger, things don't work so well.\r\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn't count clubs completely out now, but I think that it will be essential to go with a group in the future. And when I say group, I mean that there needs to be roughly the same amount of girls and guys. Tonight we had 8-9 guys and two girls... small problem. In an attempt to be courtious/brave/outgoing, a friend of mine and I went our own way in attempt to try and give those two girls a bit more room. As you can see above, I wasn't really very successful. I was lucky enough for a girl to come to me a twice. Unfortuntely for one of them I thought girl was mocking the way I was dancing. And for the other, I didn't recriprocate any \"grinding\" and was quickly left.\r\n\r\nI guess there is not much room for good old clean fun anymore.","post_title":"Clubbing","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"clubbing","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2004-07-23 01:57:44","post_modified_gmt":"2004-07-23 05:57:44","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=23","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"7"},{"ID":"24","post_author":"130","post_date":"2004-07-24 15:19:45","post_date_gmt":"2004-07-24 19:19:45","post_content":"\u003c!--exhibit:display_captions=0--\u003e\u003c!--exhibit:preview_at_top=0--\u003eI thing that I knew I had to do while I was in Boston was to go to Fenway park (Red Socks baseball stadium for you on-sports fans).

I honestly came in very worried that our project, demos, etc would merely be lackluster – fortunately I was very wrong. We (FLOOD) were no big stars, but there were several interested folks from technical to executive positions. Our presentation went well. I still messed up a few words, but no one would really notice (except those who have heard us say our presentation several times over).\r\n\r\nOther things, the Learning Center was wonderful (it's the IBM hotel/dorms on the corporate headquarters campus). The food was great, talking with executives was a special treat. Now I feel much more comfortable speaking to others, especially others whom seem important, intimidating, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm truly amazed at the focus IBM gives this Extreme Blue program. Getting the chance to hear from the chairman, senior vp's etc is a rare occasion for most IBM employees, but it is standard procedure for the EB expo. Even better was the fact that all the good things I'm hearing about IBM about Linux, OSS, standards, and IP seem to be really going on (as in that IBM is truly making the effort to open up, and stay away from the model that some other *cough* M$ *cough* companies are doing).\r\n\r\nWhat else. Career stuff. A few opportunities have popped up, at least one that is very interesting. The unfortunate thing is that this continues to make my graduate school decision significantly more difficult. If I get an enticing enough job, I just may go ahead and take it. Is there necessarily any reason to study in a specific subject that you can go straight to working in (and making money). Grad school does provide some freedom, but that comes along with its own difficulties.\r\n\r\nWell, I think that I need a nap (yes I'm tired enough to pass out on the bus)…","post_title":"Extreme Blue Expo 2004","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"extreme-blue-expo-2004","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2004-08-13 22:33:25","post_modified_gmt":"2004-08-14 02:33:25","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=27","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},{"ID":"28","post_author":"130","post_date":"2004-08-13 22:57:28","post_date_gmt":"2004-08-14 02:57:28","post_content":"So its finally time to take my leave back to good ole' MD.

I figured that I could give a small review on a couple of books I've read recently. These books fill an interesting niche; one that suites myself well, but possibly not many others.\r\n\r\nThe author of these books is Donald E. Knuth. For those who are not too familiar with Computer Science history (well recent history, Knuth is still very much alive), Knuth is called by some \"the Father of Computer Science\". He is widely known for writing three volumes of The Art of Computer Programming, which Amazon.com calls the \"definitive description of classical computer science.\"\r\n\r\nThe two books I've just finished reading, Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks  About and 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated, are different from Knuth's technical literature because the focus is not about computers, but about spirituality. These books are intertwined since Knuth uses his experiences writing 3:16 as material for Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About. But in both, he combines his experiences as a  prominent computer science academic and his experiences as a life-long Christian.\r\n\r\nI found both of these books very stimulating and I'd highly suggest for you to look into them if you are a geeky Christian like me. For others who are interested in the crossovers of religion, spirituality, and computer science, Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About may be for you. For those who would like to read about a scientist's approach to bible interpretation and translation check out 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated.\r\n\r\nFor those are not interested in any of these topics, no big deal. Hopefully I read something more in your interests soon.\r\n","post_title":"Little book review","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"little-book-review","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2004-08-22 11:19:59","post_modified_gmt":"2004-08-22 15:19:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=30","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"32","post_author":"130","post_date":"2004-08-27 22:50:59","post_date_gmt":"2004-08-28 02:50:59","post_content":"So another semester begins.

Unfortunately, it has also made me think about some of the darker sides of human nature.\r\n\r\nWhy are humans so greedy? Moreover, why are Americans especially greedy?\r\n\r\nMy case, the USA basketball team (just one of many possible examples). They have quite a reputation to live up to. I'm not going to look up statistics, but previous \"Dream Teams\" have continuously won gold medals and almost literally obliterated opposing international teams. So, it is fairly obvious to make them a favorite, the \u003cem\u003efavored\u003c/em\u003e team to win the gold.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after losing the semifinal match and losing a chance for the gold and silver expectations were far from being met. So, of course what is the natural reaction of the media (and a large majority of Americans I'm assuming)? Disappointment, and in some cases I may even expect anger. People are reacting unfavorably to our own countrymen. I'm sure they will get this Olympic memory rubbed in their faces and eventually get the underlying message that the are unworthy, no good, .....\r\n\r\nI personally think that this is ridiculous. Holding any animosity toward those players is just absurd? Do you think they wanted to lose? It thought it was quite interesting when when one of the players said in an interview that they [Dream Team] just wanted to get in and get out of Athens so they wouldn't have to deal with a big story. That story is the story which is happening, the story of not living up to expectations, the story of not getting the gold medal. \u003cem\u003e(see note about the basketball team at end of story)\u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\nHeaping all this guilt upon our athletes even before they perform? That is just wrong. Yes, it is ok to consider someone a favorite, but it is our responsibility to be supporters, always hope that they do their best, to be respectful no matter how well they do, and to be proud of them. Some of us have been so spoiled that we can only be proud of those who wear gold medals around their neck, and even worse is that when they already have gotten the gold the only acceptable outcome is a repeat.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think of a parent of a small kid at a county soccer game. When the team loses does the parent berate the child for not doing well enough? No they should be happy and proud for whatever they could do. Unfortunately, there are still many parents who can't do this. I don't even know what to say about this, when competition comes before the love of a child.\r\n\r\nI wish I knew what the root of this behavior was. There are all kinds of obvious relations to our materialistic society, spoiled children, etc. Maybe we just have a misconstrued understanding of competition. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a very competitive person (and very much enjoy winning), but competition is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e about winning! It is about trying your best, giving your all, training, sacrificing, and eventually having fun or getting enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe Olympics should not be about having the most gold medals, being the best athlete, or getting the most media attention. It is all about competition, not how our society views it, but in the manner which I (attempted) to describe earlier. I think that the friendly yet still aggressive competition the Olympics brings is helpful to each nation and helpful to our world as a whole. Is it possible for us to leave behind our selfish and greedy natures? I don't know, but I wish it were.\r\n\r\n\u003cem\u003eNote about USA basketball team:\u003c/em\u003e This example may be a bad choice since there are many other issues involved with the USA basketball team, such as the players who turned down the offer to play for the dream team and the bad choices of the selection committee. It could very well be the case that some are mostly angry at these other issues, and not as much what I was saying. But, my point is not about USA basketball though it seemed the best example to use (since I knew I was likely quite widespread).","post_title":"Why are we so greedy?","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"It has been great to watch the Olympics the past few weeks, particularly since I've been relaxing and had the time to watch quite a bit.

Finally did it. For all the years I've been playing intramural soccer at UMD, I've tried so many times to score when I still playing goalie myself. Tonight I finally got it. It helps quite a bit that intramural soccer here (in the fall) is only 6v6 (and field hockey goals) so that making a full field run is quite a bit easier. I love the suprise on the other teams face when I drop the ball and run out of my box for a crazy goalie counter attack. With most of the other team behind me, I only had to beat one player and take a shot (which 99.9% of the time is completely inaccurate.

Actually, only one significant thing happened but I'll tell you about that later (huh?). One ordinary thing I did was read a book, a very good book in fact, though since its SciFi you probably have to like that stuff to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nIts been a while since I've read any fiction (excluding the multiple readings of LOTR in the past 4 or 5 years) and when a friend of mine handed me \u003cem\u003eEnder's Game\u003c/em\u003e I figured it would be a good way to waste some time other than computer stuff, video games, and such. I'm not in the SciFi book circles so this book was new(ish) to me, but it seems like it is quite a popular book. Bestseller, awards, mentioned on Slashdot all the time, yadda, yadda. I think that the reason I enjoyed it so much was that it was not science fiction for science fictions sake only. Rather, it was a complelling story which just happens to be set in a futuristic world. It certainly does have aliens, anti-gravity, and space-ships, but more importantly it has Ender. Such a poor yet amazing little kid. The book really makes you feel for him.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't classifly the book as having super-deep themes and philosophical insights, but I also would not classify it as superficial. There is some good questions there about children, how we treat them, and how we shape them, yet for the most part it an interesting and engaging story.\r\n\r\nYou can only read so many serious things right?

I guess there was something about Thanksgiving, I'll post those pictures sometime eventually (sure...).\r\n\r\nAnyways, I've finished another project in my digital art class. This time I went a bit beyond the requirements and put a lot of effort toward making something unique and interesting. I know that I put the effort in (20+ hrs for an art project.. I'm supposed to put that much work to my CS classes right?), but you can be the judge whether it is interesting or not.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to it: \u003ca href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/flashGallery/\"\u003eThe Online Gallery\u003c/a\u003e. Below is a quick explanation and some directions.\r\n\r\nThis piece is my first experiment with an online, shared, gallery and or workspace. In this virtual gallery anyone with a web broswer can \"hang\" artwork to create his or her own exhibition for display, or edit the existing exhibition as he or she sees fit. The core idea of this gallery is that all changes you make are saved for others to see, in essence making this a ever-changing collaborative gallery.\r\n\r\n\u003ch4\u003eHow to use the gallery\u003c/h4\u003e\r\n\r\nThe interface for this piece is fairly simple. Any image can be moved by dragging it to a new position. To scale the image to a larger or smaller size simply hold the up arrow (increase size) or the down arrow (decrease size) and click and hold.\r\n\r\nTo place a new image, you must first upload the image to the server. The server will accept any jpeg image that is non-progressive (not interlaced) and is smaller than two megabytes in size. To upload an image, click on the upload button. In the new window that appears click browse to select the image from your computer. After you have selected the image click submit. Note this could take some time, depending on your connection speed\r\n\r\nAfter the image is uploaded you must refresh the flash window by pressing your browser refresh button or clicking the refresh button in the movie. The newly uploading image will now appear in the list of available images (only if the upload has successfully completed). To \"place\" the image on the wall, select it in the list and press the import button. After a few seconds the image should appear attached to the mouse, simply click the location you wish to place the image.\r\n\r\nTo delete an image just drag it to the very top or bottom of the flash window (the top or bottom of the background picture).\r\n\r\nThe buttons and list can be hidden from the screen by pressing the \"h\" key on the keyboard.\r\nAbout the work\r\n\r\nCurrently, this piece is my initial experiment and is still far from finished. I plan on working more with this in the future.

Yesterday I performed my vocal solo and today turned in my take home final today to finish up Beginning Voice. Also today I handed in my final sculpture for my Wood class. \r\n\r\nI'm going on a retreat this weekend which should be fun, but it's not the best timing since I have a final on Moday and Tuesday. Not too big of a deal though, I'm sure that I'll have plenty of time to study Friday day and Sunday night if I make myself productive.","post_title":"End of classes","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"end-of-classes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2004-12-09 17:17:59","post_modified_gmt":"2004-12-09 21:17:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=53","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},{"ID":"61","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-01-07 02:58:35","post_date_gmt":"2005-01-07 07:58:35","post_content":"Hmm, no school for another two weeks, few obligations, plently of time... shouldn't I think that that is wonderful? I think I do think that, but only superficially. Actually I'm quite worried about myself at times like this since - well - I can be horribly lazy.\r\n\r\nIts something that I don't totally understand either. Whenever I have some motivation, even if it some small or distant motivation, I will always get the job done, project completed, mind prepared, see it through, whatever it is (yea, please take that with a grain of salt. I'm leaving out all the small \"I'm not perfect, but tend to be like this\" qualifications for brevity's sake. But then I just wasted the past few sentences, and in a parenthesis for that matter! Oh well...)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that right now, I've been very blessed. My future (career-wise at least) is stable (well for an undergrad not working yet) and looks bright. So, what am I supposed to be worrying about right now? Finding work, \u003ci\u003echeck\u003c/i\u003e; paying the rent, \u003ci\u003echeck\u003c/i\u003e; figuring out where to go out on Friday night, \u003ci\u003ewell that's not quite my thing so.. check\u003c/i\u003e; getting a girlfriend? \u003ci\u003ehmm, should I be worrying about this? I think not, if it happens it happens. And you certainly are not going to see me turn in into a smooth, extroverted, seeking-bachelor anytime soon\u003c/i\u003e...\r\n\r\nOk back to my point (I have a way of rambling in these posts. I guess that happens when you are writing without much purpose). I don't feel compelled to do anything at all right now. Sure I could do this, or I could do that, but I seem to think more about what I could be doing then what I actually am doing. Eventually after thinking too much about how I could be more productive (by productive I mean still having fun while doing something with some sort of worthwhile basis. Currently some examples are programming (it is what I want to do for a living), creating more artwork (I always like doing it, but I never actually do any in my free time), and spending more time with friends, especially those that I don't give enough time to or have not seen in a while (I'm kinda prone in keeping relationships one sided and not giving my fair share of effort)).\r\n\r\nSo you see, what I end up doing is realizing that I should be doing something else and yet I still chose the option with the best ratio of pleasure received over effort required. Why am I worried about efficiency when I have no time to worry about? Good question, maybe I just tend to think that way, maybe I'm really using the previous statement as an excuse, maybe ... well, the latter is probably correct.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to do something about this. Its seems that the act of writing this was a start. But the question is, am I seeking others to think about me this way? I'm I writing this because I want others to read it and think about this, so I can set them up to think better of me? Well, I don't think that I am, but I'd have to say that I wouldn't be surprised if my subconscious has done/considered doing that before (\"subconscious considering\" Geeze now that's an oxymoron I've never heard).\r\n\r\nEnough, sometimes I'm lazy. Sometimes I'm not. I wish I were not, but I cannot ignore/excuse either side.\r\n\r\nConclusion. Since I know I can be lazy, act in a manner knowing that I could seek the lazy solution. Thinking about planning ahead for how I plan ahead? How do I do that? Not sure, but at least its a rationalization that I don't feel badly about... for now.","post_title":"Ahh break... break!?!","post_category":"1","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"ahh-break-break","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2005-01-07 03:02:05","post_modified_gmt":"2005-01-07 08:02:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=61","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"55","post_author":"130","post_date":"2004-12-16 12:14:08","post_date_gmt":"2004-12-16 16:14:08","post_content":"I hung out with Karen yesterday going out to the mall to start my Christmas shopping (well, and to find something me too).

I'm hanging around in Victor, NY (10 miles from Rochester) in my \u003cem\u003enew\u003c/em\u003e home. But, the funny thing is that my whole family is here and it just doesn't feel like home. I never have really missed our old house in Calvert County too much (though I have missed that environment), but now I do. All the old furniture and pictures look so awkward since they are familiar, but placed in a totally differnt location/context/etc...\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the house is very nice. In fact I like it quite a bit, but it just doesn't have that home feel at all. Thats not a bad thing I guess, I am kinda about to move and go live on my own soon anyways. Pictures will come (do I ever live up to those promises?).\r\n\r\nI haven't been doing much here at all other than a bit of xmas shopping, putting up pictures on the walls, and lots of reading. So far I've read two books (~400 pages) in 3-4 days. These were \u003cem\u003eEnder's Shadow\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eShadow of the Hegemon\u003c/em\u003e, following after the events in \u003cem\u003eEnder's Game\u003c/em\u003e. Well, actually not after since \u003cem\u003eEnder's Shadow\u003c/em\u003e was not a sequal, but rather a parallel story.  I think that the author pulled this off very well too, since the parallel perspective was just as interesting as the orginal story, and reading the second has only made the first more intruiging since there was so much more to the story that never came to the surface. I'm very glad to hear that the are still many books left to read in the Ender series, I get seem to get enough of that story.\r\n\r\nThe more and more I read, the more I wonder how many good books are out there? It has been quite a while since I've read something that I didn't like so I'm getting worried. Worried that I'm rationalizing to myself that the books were a good read... But I don't think that is the case.

This year I decided to give snowboarding a try since my snowboarding friends have always given me a bad time, and a few others were going to try and learn as well.\r\n\r\nI started off pretty well the first few hours but as soon as I got a bit of confidence and tried to go a bit faster the situation changed pretty quickly. I thought that I'd be able to miss all the problems everyone talks about when learning to snowboard, but boy was I wrong. The second day (I was on the mountain 4-5 hours the previous night), I woke up sore and frustrated but I couldn't give it up yet (I was really thinking about it though). Thankfully my balance finally started to click on the second day. I didn't look very good coming down the mountain, but I could make it down an easy blue slope with a few falls. So the next day, being a bit confident and reckless I pushed myself more. How about the hard blues and a black diamond? They turned out to be not much of a problem. Don't get me wrong I still was falling every once and a while (once pretty hard on a black) but by then I think I was starting to look like someone who actually knew what they were doing.\r\n\r\nSo, my suggestion to anyone learning to snowboard is to fight through the pain on the first day or so and then keep trying harder slopes than you think you can do. There are two things that could happen, one you learn much more quickly or two you could hurt yourself very badly... Hmm, maybe that isn't such a good suggestion :).\r\n\r\n Its good that being reckless with your physical self-being comes in handy every once and a while.","post_title":"Holiday update 2","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"holiday-update-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2004-12-31 13:30:38","post_modified_gmt":"2004-12-31 17:30:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=58","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"62","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-01-10 00:35:21","post_date_gmt":"2005-01-10 02:35:21","post_content":"I spent some more time with friends from high school tonight having good clean bowling fun :).

I'm the youngest of the group). Skiing/snowboarding was great, conditions were good, most of the slopes were open, I actually didn't hurt myself (I'm a rather reckless skier). The only downside to the weekend was the first night when I -- well... \u003cem\u003esomehow\u003c/em\u003e my car ended up in the ditch :(.\r\n\r\nOk, so I have somewhat of an excuse. I was trying to get up our snow-covered driveway and didn't make it all the way, so I was backing back down. When coming back down I didn't notice the drainage ditch and associated rusted and sharp metal drainage pipe behind me (it was somewhat hidden by a layer of snow), and proceeded to drive right into it. Bummer.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story shorter, we had 6-7 guys try to push it out, we took some cheap rope and tried to make a makeshift tow rope, and then waited an hour or so for a tow-truck. Eventually we (and by we I mean the tow-truck), got it out. Then, I had to change the slashed and flatten front tire. I tried to call around to see where in West Virginia I could get a new tire, but I couldn't find a place within 75 miles that carries tires for my TSX. After talking to the Accra roadside assistance people to find out that the \"donut\" spare is rated for 30,000 miles (only going under 50mph) I decided to drive home and deal with it then. Thankfully the drive home was uneventful, though it ended up taking an additional hour or two since I couldn't go over 50mph.\r\n\r\nI'm probably making this seem much worse than it was.

She came back and started typing and immediately got a distressed look on her face. She called the teacher over and explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen. The teacher tried everything. By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking red-faced.\r\n\r\nI started to type, \"Leave me alone!\"\r\n\r\nThey both jumped back, silenced. \"What the... \" the teacher said.\r\n\r\nI typed, \"I said leave me alone!\"\r\n\r\nThe kid got real upset. \"I didn't do anything to it, I swear!\"\r\n\r\nIt was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud. The conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes.\r\n\r\nMe: \"Don't touch me!\"\r\n\r\nHer: \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit your keys that hard.\"\r\n\r\nMe: \"Who do you think you are anyway?!\" Etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, I couldn't contain myself any longer and fell out of my chair laughing.

This wasn't a movie that made you run out of the theaters thinking that you saw the greatest movie of all time, but it was powerful.

It has been \u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"\u003erather interesting\u003c/span\u003e expected that graduation was anti-climactic. But aren't I supposed to be excited to be done with school? Or, shouldn't I at least be somewhat saddened that I'm leaving my college friends and experiences (even more so since I'm moving to Mass.)?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fact is that I am neither. Sure I am happy to have finished my undergraduate studies, but ya know college was a fun thing. And not only due to the social aspects, but since it was an environment where I could focus on learning. You may think that this is sad, but I truly enjoyed taking classes, listening to lectures, participating in discussions, and working on projects (though honestly I could have done without the group projects). I'm not trying to hide the fact that I was often unmotivated and disinterested for much of the work I had to do, but overall I would have to say that the classes I have taken and the work that I have done for them has been a wonderfully enriching experience. So instead of being one of those students searching for a reason to skip class, I felt motivated (though sometimes only obligated) to go. In fact, I think that the only three classes I missed in college (that I remember) were due to sleeping in 30 mins into class once, leaving class since I was too sick to pay attention, and missing class since I got hit by a car. But I digress...\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo college was a good thing and I should be sad to leave it right? Well, not really. It was a good thing but it is time to move on. Its time to take the new person I have shaped into and do something with it. Academic pursuit is a wonderful thing, but it does not bear much fruit by itself. For me this pursuit starts off with a career at IBM. So on to the next question, shouldn't I be excited to enter the real world, truly earn my own living, and begin to be able to accomplish something? Well, yes and no. I am excited about the opportunity, but at the same time I am quite aware that it is nothing particular special in of itself. By this I mean that I am not merely excited about the job cause its a job, or even a job with IBM. If I am excited about anything I am excited about the ideas and technologies that I'll be working with and the interesting things they may lead to in the future. Sure it helps (quite a lot actually) to be with a company such as IBM that has the resources, recognition, and ability to work in these areas and cause significant and worthy change, but my excitement does not stem from the reputation or money as most would expect.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWon't I be saddened to be \"leaving\" the friends I've made in college? Now this is a tough question and I hope to not to hurt anyone's feelings, but I'll be honest. I certainly will miss many people and the fun memories that I've had with them. But the thing about me is that I'm really an independent person. Some may look at me and think that I'm more of a anti-social hermit and others may say that I'm an extroverted person hiding behind a shy face, but either way I tend to not get as connected to people as others. Even if I try to keep up with people on IM, facebook, email, phone, etc I know that I will forget as time goes on. I'm just bad about those sort of things. But one thing to note is that I'm not forgetting about you as a person at all, and I'm by no means losing any appreciation for the friendship that I had with you. Its just that I honestly don't often think about communicating with others. It doesn't occur to me to check in on a person very often. I tend to live my life in the present, not worrying too much about the future, and not too often revisiting the past. Maybe I'm just a selfish person, or maybe I'm missing part of my brain that is supposed to make me wonder about other people (though I hope the real reasoning is something other than those two extremes). It's a good thing that this has started to change somewhat, and I think that I'm better at keeping tabs that I used to be, but still far from \"normal\". So what I'm trying to say is please don't be too upset if I don't talk to you as much as you think I should. I'm not trying to make an excuse to rationalize my behavior and I really hope that this is not coming off that way. The simple truth is my friends will probably have to put more effort into communication than myself in order to just maintain a relationship. Maybe this is okay with you, and maybe it isn't, but I think its better for me to say it than to make you find out.\u003c/p\u003e","post_title":"Graduation...","post_category":"1","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"graduation","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nArray\n\n","post_modified":"2005-05-25 01:36:51","post_modified_gmt":"2005-05-25 06:36:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=101","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2"},{"ID":"102","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-05-27 09:41:03","post_date_gmt":"2005-05-27 14:41:03","post_content":"Well, if you are looking at this (not in an RSS feed) you porbably have noticed that things have changed to something new (finally).

We made very good time getting out to Colorado – probably around 26 hours of total driving. On Saturday night we did get well into Missouri and slept for the night in the car at a rest stop (nice and cheap :)).\r\n\t\r\nSunday's drive went pretty smoothly, well all except for Pete's speeding ticket.  And the fact that Kansas is long, it took forever to get through that state. Our trek along I-70 was pretty monotonous until we reached the end of Kansas and got into Colorado. I was amazed by the blueness of the sky, skies I'm used to on the East coast seem to pale in comparison. It probably does help that you can see for miles and miles in any direction, making the sky seem dramatically immense. Other than a few heavy rainstorms we drove to our first destination to the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs. The rock formations were impressive, but not as nearly as much as I was expecting. Still, it was a nice place and made sure to grab way too many pictures (I'll upload some when I get a higher bandwidth link).\r\n\r\nThat's it for now, hopefully today will be a nice day to hike around Pike's Peak.\r\n","post_title":"Ah, fresh air..

Tourists can access the pike via a touring train or car. We of course didn't want to take a glitzy train up to the top (it also required reservations) so instead we drove up 19 miles along Pike's Peak Highway to reach the summit.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the park we were told that the conditions at the peak were too dangerous and no visitors were allowed above the timberline. Fortunately by the time we go up to the 13th mile the Peak was reopened. I was driving on the way up and although I was slightly uneasy driving around the twists and turns of the lower part of the mountain, the rest of the mountain was a whole different story. Gone were the paved roads, surrounding trees, and guardrails… only narrow, climbing paths was sheer drops. Yippie. It really wasn't all that bad, but it definitely made me recollect the fear of heights that had not manifested itself for some time. Despite all of this, I'd have to say that the drive was still a good idea since there were many pull-off points along the way to jump out of the car and take pictures. \r\n  \r\nEventually we got to the top, and boy was it chilly… No, not chilly but really freaking windy and cold. At 14000ft (I don't remember the exact number) it was in the low thirties and with gusts bad enough to make you lose your balance. The views (360 deg of it) were spectacular, though it was a bit hazy. Also it was a bit more difficult to appreciate the sights when you are standing in the snow holding onto the freezing railing wearing shorts. Although Pete cowered back into the car after a few minutes (sry Pete I had to :)), I tried to stick it out and take all the pictures I could. Unfortunately, I think that I lost about half of those peak photos from a droplet of water that I didn't notice on my lens. The upside is that after taking 120 pictures from one mountain, you are bound to at least get a few good ones, right?\r\n\r\nThe drive back down (Pete behind the wheel this time) was thankfully uneventful, but we made sure to stop and take a few more pictures along the way. After that we heading to a campground near our next destination and lazed of the rest of the day (which for me was reading and resting). So far, the campgrounds we have stayed at have impressed me. When I was thinking \"campground\" before I had a very different picture in my mind. But, I certainly don't mind clean bathrooms,  laundry facilities, and cheap tasty breakfast. We ate well again, thanks to that little gas burner we brought along (thanks to Bruce/Bruce's dad). Nothing fancy, but sausage links and chunky soup sure does stick to the ribs :).\r\n\r\nOk, enough of yesterday. I woke up early to read along the riverside. Our campsite was only a hop and a skip away from the river (no jump though, that probably wouldn't be a good idea to do on those rocks) since the sound of the fast-moving current was amazingly soothing. The better-food-than-back-at-home trend continued with my world famous grilled egg and cheese sandwiches (well not exactly world famous, but good enough for me).\r\n\r\nToday we took a bit of a break from the picture-taking and touristy things to raft along the river that we sleep along the previous night (Arkansas river). I had been whitewater rafting once before in West Virginia, but I was hoping that today would be more exciting (ya know, more thrilling, more danger, longer waiver forms, etc). \r\n\r\nThe run we went on was an all day trip (well really only 9:30am to 4:00pm or so), but the more exciting stuff only happened in the second half of the day in the Royal Gorge. The rapids were certainly much better than the ones I had been on before, but unfortunately the crew in my boat did too well. We didn't have any \"OH $%\u0026#\" experiences, likely due to the fact that we had a good guide and the six of us (all able-bodied guys) actually followed directions. Maybe some class V rapids (these were class IVs) will give me the thrill I'm looking for. But, it still was a lot of fun (though expensive). I certainly didn't mind the cute female guide :).\r\n\r\nAfter that it was time to get back on the road again. As we speak we're on in Utah I-70 making our way to Zion (about six hours in so far, probably another four to go). The views along route 50 earlier this afternoon/evening were spectacular. Particularly, my breath was taken away by the endless, green rolling hills carved by blue creeks and dotted with trees. It doesn't really have the same \"Wow, is that real?\" response as the impressive mountain/rock formations, but it is truly beautiful. \r\n","post_title":"Real men don't need guard rails… ","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"real-men-don%e2%80%99t-need-guard-rails%e2%80%a6","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2005-06-18 01:27:32","post_modified_gmt":"2005-06-18 06:27:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=110","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"111","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-06-17 09:48:01","post_date_gmt":"2005-06-17 14:48:01","post_content":"Whew I'm sore and tired. We spent yesterday in the Grand Canyon and.. oh wait, let me talk about the day before that first.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday we were in Zion National Park. It was pretty interesting, but its very hard for me to say anything too great about it since it was totally blown out of the water after seeing the Grand Canyon. We explored Zion's canyon by taking the tour bus and hiking around a bit. I was looking forward to doing some hiking on this trip, ya know wanting something strenuous and walking along cliffs etc. Unfortunately the hikes we went on in Zion were more like paved mountain walks than \"hiking\", but the hike in the Grand Canyon was a different story.\r\n\r\nSo yesterday we went on the North Kaibab trail on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Now that was a hike. We started the trail at 10:50am and after traveling 10 miles round trip, going down and then back up 3500ft of elevation, drinking 4 liters of liquid, eating two sandwiches, chips, peanuts, and powerbars, 200 some pictures, and 5 hours and 10 minutes later we reached where we started (well Pete got back a bit later since I pushed ahead and ditched him on the way back, sorry Pete). Whew, that was a challenge and more than satisfied my hiking desire, and I absolutely loved it. By the top I got back to the top I was dead tired. That's what I get for trying to push myself as fast as I could go up steep inclines for over two hours. That may have been some of the best exercise I've had in quite a long time.\r\n\r\nAnyways the Grand Canyon is simple amazing. It is certainly called \"Grand\" for a reason. The views from the hike were amazing and provide and inside, close-up perspective of the canyon, but the observation points at the rim were simple stunning. Its just so, large, natural, and beautiful. I definitely recommend seeing it sometime :).\r\n\r\nToday is a driving day. The goal is to get to the Grand Teton mountain by nightfall.

Both Grand Teton Ntl. Park and Yellowstone Ntl. Park have rounded off the trip with spectacular views and sights yet again completely different than the rest of the trip.\r\n\r\nAfter driving past Salt Lake City (and unfortunately you couldn't really see the lake from the road, maybe we should have stopped), we stayed the night in yet another KOA campground (did I say yet how cool those places are?) near to the Grand Teton entrance. If the defining feature of the Grand Canyon was enormous rock formations, staggering cliffs, and unreal natural formations, then the defining features of the Grand Tetons were sharp and princely snow-covered mountains and graceful lakes and rivers filled with a wonderful clear/light turquoise water. Unlike the Grand Canyon, the Tetons didn't feel unreal. It felt amazingly real. By that I mean that the views you see there are the kind that nature is supposed to look like. I sat and admired the scenery feeling that this is what the world is supposed to look like (well not everything exactly looking the same, but you know what I mean). And it wasn't just the vista-esque views that were this way, but practically the entire park. The hike we went on took us around a lake, up a bit of the mountain, and then back down to a secluded waterfall. The sights from the trail were equally as beautiful, but unfortunately they were also had throngs of tourists snapping pictures (I can't blame them though). I still can't believe how clear, clean and refreshing the water looked. It almost beckoned me to take a sip (though I knew that was probably a bad idea). I'm probably carrying on a bit too much, but I highly enjoyed the Tetons. It certainly won't appeal to everyone the same way it has to me, but if you elegance and cleanliness of nature, that's the place to go.\r\n\r\nOur final stop was Yellowstone, and even with two days of touring we still didn't get to see the entire park. I'll get out my two frustrations first so I'm not thinking about them while I'm talking about the good stuff. First of all, the camping/lodging reservation/infrastructure systems stunk. Antiquated garbage. We originally signed up for two nights at Canyon village campground and came the morning of the second day to reserve a third. First we were given the reservation and then we noticed that it wasn't for the next day but rather the current day. That wasn't right so we went back. We then were told that the system could not reserve anything until we checked out after 10:00. So we wasted a bit of time and came back. I think that the campgrounds was full (maybe I'm exaggerating since I don't remember exactly) but by then I felt that we could see almost everything else in the park that day so we could grab a campground outside (ie in Cody, WY where we are right now).\r\n\r\nThe second annoyance was road closures. The Yellowstone staff made it obvious that one of the main roads inside the park was closed. That closure wasn't a big deal at all, just a minor annoyance that caused us to drive a bit more than if it had been open. The real annoyance was that the road to the east entrance of the park closed from 8:00pm to 8:00am. We didn't know this at all and noticed the closure sign around 7:50pm when we were more than 15 miles away from this to-be-closed road. We pulled around and asked a ranger to be sure, and then frustrated we turned around to redrive the last two hours we drove to get to the East exit (the next best exit was back where we came from just before, and by next best exit I mean adding an additional 3-4 hours to our trip out). Ergg… That certainly was annoying, but really we had time so I shouldn't get too pressed about it. We later discovered that the East exit road closure was listed in small print of the back of the newspaper we were handed, but it would have been nice if they had made it more obvious.\r\n\r\nAnyways, Yellowstone certainly had the most interesting individual sights to see (and the most different). Yellowstone had several of the same kinds of features some of the other parks had. It had forests, large lakes, and views of mountain scenery. It even had its own canyon with associated river and falls (it was called the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone). But none of these were the defining features of Yellowstone. The real features were the abundant wildlife and equally abundant hot springs and geysers.\r\n\r\nThe roads in Yellowstone are kind-of slow to start with, but they become much slower when you have people stopping every few miles to look and take pictures of bison, mule deer, and bears (those are the ones we saw, we didn't see any elk or moose). I'm not a huge wildlife fan but seeing just how large these animals are and seeing them in their natural habitat was very cool. (And yes I got to shot pictures of a bear from only 30 yards away or so, but it was only a cub so it was not quite as thrilling).\r\n\r\nNow the thermal features of Yellowstone are something else. The colors of the hotsprings are totally different than anything I've ever seen in nature before. The are hard to describe, so my pictures will have to do them justice later on. The geysers are of course amazing (though only really so when they are going off, other than that they are kinda boring rock steam spouts). We sat and waited for Old Faithful and he wasn't quite as prompt as promised (the rangers gave a plus or minus 10 minute time frame, but it went off more around 20 mins late). As Old Faithful was going off, I was taking so many pictures that I almost forgot to look. It is unfortunate that the geyser spout didn't quite live up to all the hype surrounding it, but it still was cool nonetheless. I'm quite amazed that such a natural phenomenon is predictable less than the magnitude of hours (though the other geysers has much larger prediction ranges. Some were +- hours, and others years).\r\n\r\nI'm cutting Yellowstone short (especially since we were there two days) but I should get going. Time to pack up camp and get on back to the east coast. We'll probably be back sometime Thursday (depends on how much we stop to see on the way back).\r\n","post_title":"Ahh nearing an end...","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"ahh-nearing-an-end","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2005-06-21 12:31:44","post_modified_gmt":"2005-06-21 17:31:44","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=113","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"5"},{"ID":"114","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-06-23 22:58:46","post_date_gmt":"2005-06-24 03:58:46","post_content":"Arg... well we got back today, but unfortunately my car didn't make it back with us.

It was bent up enough that the metal was rubbing against the wheel, so driving it more than a few feet would probably be a bad idea.\r\n\r\nI'm nearly sure that this is not my fault, especially since my car was already mostly past his parked vehicle - basically broadsiding me - so insurance should cover all the costs.

ARGGG....\r\n\r\nWell, at least I'm fortunate enough that this happened close to home (and after the trip rather than before), the situation could have been much worse. I should probably be thankful that my first accident happened in parking lot at 10 miles an hour instead of on the highway at 60.\r\n\r\nSuch is life.\r\n\r\n\t\u003cdiv class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Car/Accident/dsc_0220.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/gallery/sp_getthumb.php?source=Photographs/Car/Accident/dsc_0220.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cspan\u003edsc_0220.jpg\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003cdiv class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Car/Accident/dsc_0227.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/gallery/sp_getthumb.php?source=Photographs/Car/Accident/dsc_0227.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cspan\u003edsc_0227.jpg\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003cdiv class=\"imgwrapper\" style=\"height:160px;width:124px;text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/gallery/sp_index.php?file=./Photographs/Car/Accident/dsc_0222.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/gallery/sp_getthumb.php?source=Photographs/Car/Accident/dsc_0222.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003cspan\u003edsc_0222.jpg\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv style=\"clear:left\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n","post_title":"Soo close....","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"soo-close","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2005-06-26 22:25:00","post_modified_gmt":"2005-06-27 03:25:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=114","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2"},{"ID":"115","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-07-13 22:15:05","post_date_gmt":"2005-07-14 03:15:05","post_content":"So I've been in Mass. for a few weeks now and getting settled in the new apartment and with the new job.

Honestly, I really have not had the oppurtunity to actually get involved into work yet at all, but that will be started soon (and dorkily, I can't wait to dive in). \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in what I'm doing at IBM, \u003ca href=\"http://domino.watson.ibm.com/cambridge/research.nsf/242252765710c19485256979004d289c/82869318e9f8f90385256cb80054bfb2?OpenDocument\"\u003ehere's a paper\u003c/a\u003e that describes the research prototype that our product implementation is based upon.  To some it may be a bunch of jargon and buzzwords, but really guys this could be big deal. The electronic forms of communication used alongside the wonderful widespread network we call the Internet have caused amazing strides in productivity, but they have not really changed to keep up with the times. I don't mean to say that email, im, etc are outdated at all, but the manner in which we are using these technologies has arguably become more of a hindrance than benefit in some cases (this point is being made from business/enterprise perspective and not necessarily a home user). For many, keeping track of their extensive and varied electronic communication and growing email volume is quite a daunting task. IBM is working on this problem by shifting the collaboration pardigm from being application-centric (as in email, im, etc is separe and non-integrated) to being activity centric (think of having activities which you attach various collobartive elements to). But to cut myself off before I start rambling on, I'm excited about it (ya think?).\r\n\r\nIn other news, since moving into the apartment I've already gotten an itch to build/fix up something, so I'be built.. well I don't know exactly what I should call it but it involves 23 one foot cubed organizing units (the ones you get from Target, actually 8 pairs of cubes and one 3x3 set of cubes), a few 8 foot long 2x6s, and plenty of screws. That probably makes no sense at all, a picture will help (when I get back).\r\n\r\nThat brings me to my next topic, I'm actually not at my apartment right now but in an IBM new hire orientation in Armonk, NY. This is the same place I got to stay \u003ca href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=27\"\u003elast summer\u003c/a\u003e for Extreme Blue and boy, IBM sure does know how to wine and dine.

The drive down was quite horrendous, but was totally my fault. I'll remember to drive around New York next time since going through it (on 95) during rush hour is a very bad idea (bad enough to delay your trip 2-3 hours). Other than that small itch, the trip seemed to go by rather quickly (the podcasts that I brought along were quite a help).\r\n\r\nSaturday was quite busy. We got up early to head over to my friend Ellis's place that's near the bay south of Baltimore. \u003ca href=\"http://spi.panaverse.com/journal/\"\u003eSteve\u003c/a\u003e and I got our first doses of watersking which was quite fun. After a few hours of that, we headed back to 's\u003ca href=\"http://www.semantichive.com/\"\u003ePete's\u003c/a\u003e place to go off in different directions. Steve was heading to hang out with a friend that was at UMD for the summer, and I drove down to good ol' Calvert County to hang out with the high school buds at \u003ca href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/chris\"\u003eChris's\u003c/a\u003e graduation party. We (as in Chris, Ter, Laura, Cor(ine)y, and me) just talked and caught up on whats going on (and ate good party food too). Its a bummer that I couldn't stay longer there, but there was yet more people to see and things to do! \r\n\r\nNext I caught up with my good friend Karen and head over to a party in Arlington (and yes I live in Arlington Ma, but this is Arlington Va). The party was held by a bunch of recently graduated UVAers, one of which was the boyfriend of Karen's future roommate. We didn't spend too long there, but I did mange to convince Karen to play a game of foosball (she did pretty well for the first time). Afterwards we head back to her place and watched the second Harry Potter movie (she had just read the 6th book and I was just about to read it). I forgot how long the movie was and unfortunately ended up not heading back to Pete's until 2:00am.\r\n\r\nNothing exciting happened on Sunday. In the morning I washed the Saturn and Steve and I helped me drop off the cars at my aunt's place in Leesburg. Shortly after we were back on the road to Mass. and thankfully the trip was quite a bit shorter than the way down (we avoided New York  this time). Oh and for this drive I was driving my car again... finally.  I really have been spoiled by my car, driving it feels like a dream as compared to the Saturn I had been using (no offense to the previous users).\r\n\r\nI wish I had more time down there, but I'm very glad to see all the people I did. I'm sorry for those I missed (\u003ca href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/always_a_terp/\"\u003eBill\u003c/a\u003e, Joo, Tom, \u003ca href=\"http://benzene.diaryland.com/\"\u003eIrene\u003c/a\u003e, and the other UMDers). I didn't try to get a hold of you since I didn't have any time available :(.\r\n\r\nAnd for the rest of the week in a much shorter version: work, frisbee, work, work, hanging out with new IBMers and seeing \u003cem\u003eThe Island\u003c/em\u003e work, work, frisbee, out at the Redline (bar) with Dan and friends from out of town, and then today playing RISK on the commons with the same guys (\u003ca href=\"http://spilog.org/archives/2005/07/30/let-the-war-begin/\"\u003esome pictures of the game\u003c/a\u003e at Steve's blog).","post_title":"Chuggin along...","post_category":"1","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"chuggin-along","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2005-07-31 10:17:41","post_modified_gmt":"2005-07-31 15:17:41","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=117","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},{"ID":"118","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-07-31 00:53:05","post_date_gmt":"2005-07-31 05:53:05","post_content":"Very interesting stuff. Since I'm too lazy to extensively respond, I'll try to make this quick.\r\n\u003cem\u003eLol, nevermind. This short comment on \u003ca href=\"http://torrez.us/archives/2005/07/27/374\"\u003eElias's blog\u003c/a\u003e grew in to quite a long trackback.\u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\nAs a guy who caught onto the Semantic Web \"hype\" after people started to frown upon hearing the word, it bothers me how differently everyone defines the Semantic Web. Honestly, to me the Semantic Web has no direct baring to the RDF format. Although I think that having much more data published/presented/serviced in RDF will (greatly) help the promise of the Semantic Web become a reality, RDF does not have to be the enabling factor.\r\n\r\nYou could ask if I'm talking about RDF syntax (RDF/XML, N3, etc) or about the nature of RDF as a directed graph of relations between resources. I'd answer good question :). But really, I'm mostly saying that the syntax doesn't matter... I don't think I know enough to say whether the Semantic Web could come around with a drastically different knowledge model, but ya know maybe it could.\r\n\r\nSo what exactly do I think the Semantic Web means? I'm going to have a hard time pinning it down, but I'll try my best. To me the Semantic Web is all about taking the \"next step\" for the web. The web has gone through many of these \"steps\" such as moving from static pages to dynamic ones and the growth of web services. Both of these things took time to happen (and I'm sure the technologies to do them were around way before they became mainstream), but they were big improvements in the functionality and range of possibilities that the web could offer previously.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that this \"nest step\" will help bring together all the wonderful knowledge and services that the web offers. Some of you will go, \"Oh you are talking integration BS like a marking person or something.\" And maybe someone would say, \"You already can integrate websites and services now. Just break out your \u0026lt;insert favorite language\u0026gt; do some SOAP/XML/REST/screen scraping and you're done!\"\r\n\r\nTo both I would say guilty as charged. For the first, I think that you need to give more credit to the marketing guys. Its true that marketing types and hypes can get ahead of themselves, but really people want things integrated. They want things to JUST WORK! Why should the user have to understand two different formats, two different applications, two different whatevers to actually get one thing done!? Integration is all about making things more intuitive and seamless for the user.\r\n\r\nFor the second, yea you are right. Developers can relatively simply do those things to bring together disparate information and services on the web. But that's the problem, you (most of the time) need to be a developer. Is that good enough? No. Imagine a world where everyday users can pull together web info which would currently require a developer to do. Ya know that really sweet \u003ca href=\"http://www.housingmaps.com/\"\u003ewebsite/webservice\u003c/a\u003e that put \u003ca href=\"http://www.craigslist.org/\"\u003ecraigslist\u003c/a\u003e stuff on a \u003ca href=\"http://maps.google.com/\"\u003eGoogle Map\u003c/a\u003e? (Well if you don't know, its quite freaking awesome) Anyways, it took some coder with some very bright ideas and swank javascript skills to pull that off. What if a normal user could do this easily by just browsing craigslist and google maps and just ask the browser to \"connect\" the data from both?\r\n\r\nYes that kind of functionality is pretty far off, but that is what the Semantic Web is all about. If you think that I'm wacky to think of the \"browser\" doing this, well then go and play with \u003ca href=\"http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu/\"\u003eHaystack\u003c/a\u003e and checkout what a Semantic Web browser could be like. Haystack is still very much a work in progress (at least since I was last involved a year ago) but the \"browser paradigm\" it is pushing could possibly enable that functionality in the future.\r\n\r\nSo where are we now? I don't think I really know very well, but interesting things are happening with RSS/ATOM, RDF, things like Haystack, and all the talk about REST web services. I'm sure that there are many many more cool things pushing in the Semantic Web direction that I don't know about, but hey -- I haven't been thinking about this stuff for a while (so gimme a break :) ).\r\n\r\nWhew, I hope that some of this made sense.\r\n","post_title":"The Semantic Web...","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-semantic-web","to_ping":"","pinged":"http://torrez.us/archives/2005/07/27/374/trackback/\nhttp://torrez.us/archives/2005/07/27/374","post_modified":"2005-07-31 01:02:17","post_modified_gmt":"2005-07-31 06:02:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=118","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"119","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-08-25 23:05:09","post_date_gmt":"2005-08-26 04:05:09","post_content":"Hey, long time no blog, but I guess that's the regular for me now.\r\n\r\nSo work, life, and everything else have been sailing along. I finally feel like I'm actually working now and not just a new hire floundering about. But whats going on other than work?  I've been hit by a stretch of visitors recently, my parents the past weekend and my Aunt Liza and cousin DJ the weekend before that.\r\n\r\nMy Aunt was on her way back from Maine and stopped in at Arlington for an afternoon. It was awfully hot and humid that day so we decided to stay in and around Arlington - just to hang out, grab some food, and get time to play video games with my younger cousin :). I got a chance to break out my  \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution\"\u003eDDR\u003c/a\u003e pads again (it's been quite some time) to show DJ how funny a white boy dancing to psychedelic Japanese techno-music can look.\r\n\r\nThe past weekend my parents were in town doing the official \"checking-on-your-newly-working-child-and-making-sure-they-are-surviving\" trip. \u003cem\u003eYes Mom, thats a joke :).\u003c/em\u003e They arrived Friday afternoon and that night we walked around town and decided on going to a Asian restaurant just a minutes walk from my apartment (ya know, I didn't notice how many Asian and Indian restaurants Arlington hade before).I chose to go with my standard Koren choice, Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop, since I couldn't gather the courage to go for the sushi (one of these days...). Despite the somewhat lackluster service and appearance, the food was quite good.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday we headed down into the city to tour around. We (and everone else and their mother as well it seemed) took advantage of the nice weather to walk the \u003ca href=\"http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/\"\u003eFreedom Trail\u003c/a\u003e and catch a ride on the one and only \u003ca href=\"http://www.bostonducktours.com/\"\u003eDuck Tour\u003c/a\u003e :). I highly recommend both to whomever has not visited in recent history (really... you skeptics may think the Duck Tour looks corny, but its rather enjoyable so don't miss it). For the rest of the time we made sure to have a few drinks and cups of clam chowder and eventually finished up with a wonderful dinner at Legal Seafood. Good times, I was glad to see the folks and happy to know that my mom shouldn't be worried sick anymore :).\r\n\r\nAnd there is still more to come! Karen will be up next weekend visting, and I will try my best to show her some of the Boston nightlife (oh, I'm \u003cem\u003esuch\u003c/em\u003e the expert there).

I'm not changing my opinion, but I really should have been less direct and less judgemental. I like to think that I'm normally pretty good about trying to express my opinions as just that -- options. But it seems like I didn't do that so well this time. I apologize if I offended anyone. This is obviously a touchy topic for me, though it really is not something I worry about that often. As my mom commented, why the heck do I worry about these things so much? I don't have a good answer to that, but its something I should certainly think about.\u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\n\"Our ability to be intelligently unintelligent never ceases to astound me\" -- \u003ca href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/chris/?p=16\"\u003eChris Hayden\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\r\nWell said -- there are no disagreements here. One tidbit I'd like to add is that Evolution and Creationism are not contradictory ideas (in my perspective). They only become contradictory when one takes the language from Genesis literally (and pushing fundamentalist I would add).\r\n\r\nLet me break out my bible (whew, its been a while!). The rest of you can read at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%20;\u0026version=31;\"\u003eBible Gateway\u003c/a\u003e if you so desire.\r\n\r\nSo there are three main issues here (or three obvious issues that I think are the most prevalent). The length of God's creation work, the creation of Adam from \"the dust of the ground\" (Genesis 1:7), and the creation of Eve from Adam's rib.\r\n\r\nThe basic, basic evolutionary story is just that life started out as simple singular celled organisms in the ocean that eventually (aka billions of years) evolved in to all the biological diversity we have today. If you take the six days of creation as metaphoric/artistic symbolism Genesis's language does agree that God made life sequentially and gradually both beliefs can coexist peacefully. I also remember reading somewhere that the the original Hebrew word used there for \"day\" did not necessarily connote the literal \"day\" that we think of (maybe someone with more motivation and better memory can provide more info).\r\n\r\nNow some of you may say that I totally glazed over the \"metaphoric/artistic\" point, and yes I did. The reason being that it is quite involved to eloguently argue why the Bible should be taken from a more artistic, more \u003cem\u003estorylike\u003c/em\u003e perspective (aka above my ability) . So instead I'll be blunt. Look, life isn't simple. As modern humans we ask lots of questions and want answers. Things are easier when the answers are given to us verbatim, and many people want to make the Bible an answer book since that would be nice and convenient (and make life simple, careless, \u003cstrong\u003eand absolutely boring\u003c/strong\u003e). If the Bible was an answer book then it wouldn't be so freaking complex and it would actually give answers (most of the time it only makes me ask more questions).\r\n\r\nThe Bible is not about the words (how many translations and versions are there?). It is about the experience. The experience of engaging in a search for knowledge and truth by following a compelling/artistic/historical/fictional/gruesome/intimate story.\r\n\r\nSince its late and I'm not motivated to write a long (well, longer I guess) theological rant, I won't say too much more. I would like to say that not a single person in the world takes the entire Bible literally.

The phones have been decent and the reception has been above average. Heck, sometimes I got one bar of service at my good ol' home in the \"ruralburbs\" of Southern Maryland (that's rural for y'all urbanites and a suburb for those whom have a more country descent).\r\n\r\nSo why start complaining now? Well its because I'm finally joining the rest of the world that wants to do more with a cell phone than just talk. The first thing that comes to mind is txt messaging. I never bought into the txt hype for the past few years since it never seemed very useful. Sure I could do in situations when I couldn't talk... but in how many of those situations is it convenient to mangle my thumbs for 5 minutes writing a few sentence message?\r\n\r\nSo why now? I'm trying to fix my forgetfulness. In the past I've tried to use pdas but unfortately those always ended up lost, broken, or stuck in a black hole in my backpack from which there was no return (aka, I never remembered to use it). Recently, I've been hyped by the \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000280/104-3367414-0941565?v=glance\"\u003eGTD\u003c/a\u003e  \u003ca href=\"http://merlin.blogs.com/\"\u003ephenomena\u003c/a\u003e and have started using a \u003ca href=\"http://merlin.blogs.com/43folders/2004/09/introducing_the.html\"\u003ehipster pda\u003c/a\u003e. So far that actually has not been working too badly and I've found it very useful for keeping track of tasks at work. (Plus it has the benefit of being a pda that won't break and costs a few bucks). The problem is that I forget to carry it around with me. And when I actually do carry it I don't ever take it out... the same problems with the fancy electronic pdas. So I'm still seeking help for remembering to calling that person back, picking up milk at the grocery store, or finally getting around to get someone to fix that window I broke in my apartment (whoops).\r\n\r\nSo what is something I do always carry around with me? My phone (even more so when I don't have a land line.. well that's a lie, I do have a land line since its free with our current telcom setup, but I don't even know what the number is). And now, since all the new fangled Web 2.0 apps can send txt msgs (namely \u003ca href=\"http://www.backpackit.com\"\u003ebackpackit\u003c/a\u003e) I can alert myself via my cellphone. Just set a reminder and later (when I'm sure I've totally forgotten about the reminder I've set) I'll get a nice vibration in my pocket and just the kind of kick in the but I need to actually remind myself to do something. And even better, I can txt from my phone to backpackit to remotely jot down something on the web. Next throw in a cell phone with a basic web browser and I'm in cell phone notes/reminder heaven.\r\n\r\nSo how does this all come back to Verizon? The cost of txt msgs. I know that txt messenging is all the rave in the rest of the world, but things have been somewhat slow in the US. Right now, without getting a plan change I'm charged 10 cents for every txt msg sent or received. You are kidding me right? Ok, lets do some math. I pay $40 for 450 minutes so that is around 9 cents a minute. So one text message costs more than a minute of air time? Lets assume that my cell phone can transfer data at around 50Kbps (and it probably can transfer \u003ca href=\"http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cell-phone11.htm\"\u003emuch faster\u003c/a\u003e). That events out to be 6250 bytes per second. So a txt message has a max size of 160 characters and I'll be nice and assume they are using a double-byte chatacter set. That's 320 bytes. Sure the data has to be packaged up somehow, but there is no way that packet it even going to approach 5000 bytes. By my (wonderfully assuming) calculations a txt message uses up a fraction of a second of air time. Sure I left out the whole part about having to check and negotiate for a connection, but come on that can't be the sole cost of the message, can it?\r\n\r\nArg... sure I can get around this by paying $5 a month for a whole whopping 50 messages.. ahem. Thats. Still. The. Same. Price. Even better the I can get the \"Great Deal\" of 250 messages for $10! The sad thing is that despite this rant, I'll be signing up for that Great Deal next month. Sigh.\r\n\r\nI guess supply and demand is only a benefit if people actually pay attention to how much something costs. So America please start txting like the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nps: I did a bit of looking around and it seems like the other companies are about the same, though some do offer decently priced additional txt plans. Fortunately/unfortunately nearly all of my family (and a few friends) have Verizon, so free in calling prevents me from switching carriers.","post_title":"Can you hear me now?","post_category":"5","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"can-you-hear-me-now","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2005-10-11 20:57:51","post_modified_gmt":"2005-10-12 01:57:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=125","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"4"},{"ID":"126","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-10-12 22:27:54","post_date_gmt":"2005-10-13 03:27:54","post_content":"![48204515][small][] I finally added a disclaimer...  so at least I'm not breaking one of \u003ca href=\"http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=351\u0026entry=81328\"\u003eIBMs Blogging Guidlines\u003c/a\u003e.

It is obvious that trying to make yourself productive by worrying about it constantly only suffices to waste time that you could have used to actually do work. Yet I rarely notice that this is exactly what I'm doing -- and moreover I think that the previous assertion only just scratches the surface.\r\n\r\nSo the first step is admitting that you have a problem, right? I certainly am the type that constantly is calculating my time and what I can do to promote better usage of my time. The funny thing is that after calculating and forecasting I barely ever end up actually making productive use of any of it. My prime example is that I normally set my alarm every day since I can't let myself sleep in and waste that precious extra hour I could be using to do something. And guess what happens with that extra hour?\r\n\r\nI think the root of the problem is that by worrying in advance, I'm already making negative associations in my mind with a task/project. I'm making myself feel guilty already and by the time I sit down to get started, I react against that guilt and end up feeling more compelled to \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e do it. Wasn't the whole point to help myself get things done in the first place?\r\n\r\nFortunately I don't often get into this cycle during my day job (probably since there are so many other external motivating factors at work, such as career development, gaining respect from peers and management, and money -- or lack thereof if fired).  But for everything else, errands, chores, projects, coding, artwork, and unfortunately socializing, I do (some to a greater or lesser extent though).\r\n\r\nThe plan is to almost force myself to waste time, in order to make myself better utilize that time. (A better idea is probably to just have more things to do so that I just fit in what I want to do when I can. I bet making myself more busy will make myself a heck of a lot more productive).\r\n","post_title":"Laziness...","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"laziness","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2005-10-15 15:32:39","post_modified_gmt":"2005-10-15 20:32:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/?p=128","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3"},{"ID":"129","post_author":"130","post_date":"2005-10-15 17:05:22","post_date_gmt":"2005-10-15 22:05:22","post_content":"![41046248][small][] Very \u003ca href=\"http://lessig.org/freeculture/free.html\"\u003einteresting presentation\u003c/a\u003e from \u003ca href=\"http://www.lessig.org/bio/short/\"\u003eLawrence Lessig\u003c/a\u003e on copyright and freedom (or lack thereof).

Quite eloquent yet still same old Chris underneath.\r\n\r\nI think that you are quite right that the religious \"seed\" of many comes from such spiritually inspiring situations. It is unfortunate that as our memory of the experience fades in time we tend (we as in the world) to latch on to the dogmas we've learned/been taught/guilt-ed into rather than maintaining the captivating sense of wonder we originally experienced. \r\n\r\nI believe this happens since seeking the truth is difficult, in fact I would even call it scary. When searching for truth you are teetering on a razor-thin cliff which is constantly crumbling underfoot as you ascend. At some point you realize that you have no choice but to switch to another equally precarious ledge in order to continue. The new path will become safer over time, but inevitably it will start to crumble and you will repeat the process again, and again, and ...\r\n\r\nIsn't is easier, safer, and more practical to stop and set up camp when the path broadens? Yes in fact it is. But don't you remember why you started the climb in the first place? Was it to reach safe ground? Or was it to get a better look at the stars in the sky? \r\n\r\nIts true that some of you have been carried up some distance unknowingly. Some of you have accepted this and learned to live where you were placed. Yet a few others have either stormed ahead or ran back down as fast as possible, arms failing.\r\n\r\nNo matter how you have gotten to where you are remember why you have set off on this climb. If you don't know that answer there is no shame climbing back down. As soon as you reach the bottom you will realize that there is only one way to go -- up. You may decide to climb right back up the path you went down or start up another one entirely, but at least this time you will know why.\r\n\r\nAnd equally there is no shame to continue climbing up, even without reason or assurance. You may come to place where you can no longer continue up and have to come back down. But that is not a bad thing since you have learned that the path you were on was not for you.\r\n\r\nIn fact there there is no shame however fast you are moving up or down, as long as you are moving. Sure every once and a while you may stop and take in the view, but hopefully another glance at the stars will set you in motion again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd have to say that I'm currently taking a slow stroll down mine.

I've been playing soccer on the weekends, joined up on a co-ed team but that season has already ended. We had quite a run, but despite being undefeated we lost in the first round of playoffs (bummer, our excuse is that we were missing a few of our better players). It was good to get back on the field again, especially to rust off my field skills (I actually did score a few goals, though not as the UMD 6 a side intramural dribble-up-as-the-goalie-and-score-after-running-the-whole-field.

Another notable time was going out to a karoke bar with the soccer team. Although the average age of our group (quite a big group actually) and the rest of the place was quite different (no so much the happening spot) we still had a good time, and I got to do my rendition of \"You've lost that loving feeling\".

The best of these are details which you use without realizing or without prior knowledge. Simple examples are right clicking on an object  to see what you can \"do\" with it or using page up/down in some application (like a photo app) without taking the time to think \"I wonder if page up will move to the previous picture\" -- it's when you try something and then realize (afterward) that you did it by native reflex, without thought at all.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is a problem with getting excited about stumbling on seamlessly intuitive UI features. You are prone to get frustrated when those things \"that should just work\" don't work. :)\r\n\r\nToday's example of that is clicking a link while visiting a web page. Its not every time you click a link, but those times when you realize \"oh crap, I didn't want to click on that... now I have to rush really quickly to try and hit the stop button before the next page loads (and man is that stop button small)\". What I tried today is clicking on the link again after realizing I didn't want to go to that page. I think my mind tried this since there are many hide/open ui patterns in many of the new AJAX websites. My mind must have jumped and tried out that same pattern in this (different) situation, but alas -- it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nSo this is where I say \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nAnd now this is the point where I realize my intention of just mentioning a tiny ui feature is blown out of proportion by me doing all of this extraneous explanation.\r\n\r\nSo yea, its a small thing but at least I think it would be useful.\r\n\r\nSo while I'm on this topic another small ui gesture I'd love to have is feed readers (news aggregators/whatever name is in vogue now) that display the length of a post alongside the title. Maybe it's a number of paragraphs, maybe it's a small icon to represent the long posts, maybe it's some representative color gradient. All it has to do is give me some blurry impression whether the post is \"more longish\" or \"more shortish\". That could makes broswing/flipping though feeds much, much easier. If its a feed that I'm only semi interested in then I can just skip over the long ones. (I guess I'm the kind of person that feels guilty stopping reading something halfway through). Ever since my feed reader has gone out of control (I spent much of today trying to work on this) I've had to start breezing though all the \"possibly less interesting\" entries instead of reading everything (in addition to dropping the blogs I just never got around to).\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm making such a deal about these simple touches is that I really do think they make quite a large difference when amortized over the long term. (oh yea, and also if enough people hear about it and become interested they might get the motivation to write feature requests for me) :)\r\n\r\nOh.. just one more thing.

And I think it brings up some notions of Art that don't come with all those dusty textbook definitions from my Art theory class. I've certainly heard things about capturing/substance and difficulty/size/complexity but decisions -- that is a new vantage point.\r\n\r\nI like the notion of the decision making of/on/about Artwork because if you have ever been in the process of seriously trying to create -- it seems like its all you are doing. Creating a mark of such shape, texture or bracketing your shot to attempt to get the exact exposure you want or decrescendoing till the note falls from your lips or designing your software abstraction in such an elegant and comprehensive fashion (well to start at least. we all know that abstractions are \u003ca title=\"leaky\" href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html\"\u003eleaky\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca title=\"spherical\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Lagoon/5923/story.htm\"\u003espherical\u003c/a\u003e).\r\n\r\nThe problem with decisions is that the term feels so rigid. Even the most non-organic of us still don't think in black and white despite the fact our minds make us think that we do. You could never take a piece of Artwork and create a flow-chart from it. If you could, well... you are super-anal or its no where near a piece of art (moving to lowercase due to laziness). The decisions you make -- while very intensive -- are more often subtle (sometimes unknowingly subtle)  or spontaneous and intuitive. Calculated decision making certainly takes place in artwork. \"I like that wash, but I need to balance it.\" ... \"How can I support the weight of that?\"  ...\"I need to use higher-speed film/this rated flash for this light.\" ... But, if you are you trying to create solely formulaicly\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003e you will have a very difficult time (psst.. your subconscious is actually smarter than you think, let it have a bit more control every once and a while).\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that software is too black and white to be artistic? No way! I've already talked closely to this topic a bit before when I compared software to literature (\u003ca title=\"word\" href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/doc/tim-finley-programming-as-literature.doc\"\u003eword\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca title=\"sxw\" href=\"http://www.timmfin.net/doc/tim-finley-programming-as-literature.sxw\"\u003esxw\u003c/a\u003e). In fact I think software is extremely artistic. Writing software is like having to elegantly dance a story around various constraints (hardware, language, requirements, OS, dependencies...). Sometimes you have to  tip-toe, sometimes leap, but it all must be smoothly interconnected and yet still be recognized as part of a whole.\r\n\r\nWhere I disagree with Rand(s?) is his critical eye of modern art. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of it either (most of the time), but it does have its place in the art world. One part of art is the progression of itself. Post Moderns built off the Moderns built off the Abstractionists built off the Cubists built off the Impressionists built off the Romantics... I really am no art buff (believe me, I just looked at Wikipedia to make sure that what I just said isn't too glaringly wrong), but I feel that part of the point of modern art is that it is so different that you have a difficult time placing it as art. Artists need to explore, need to push the boundaries, and also need to cross the line. If there wasn't anyone saying something isn't art, then how can it be art?\r\n\r\nI help rationalize this because I do not think that there is anything that completely un-artful (yes double negatives can sometimes make more sense then their counterpart). So art to me is more of a spectrum to me than a classification. And more so, things can be more artistic to some than others. This has to be true since so much of the importance is the experience you have with the work. A piece can only be boring if everyone had the same response! Then all you would have to do is read a review to tell you what that response is.\r\n\r\nWhew.. why don't you go forth and break some new boundies then?\r\n\r\n\u003cem\u003e \u003cfont size=\"2\"\u003e * probably not a word, but I like it nonetheless\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/em\u003e","post_title":"Art.. and a bit of software","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"art-and-a-bit-of-software","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttp://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2005/09/30/signs_of_art.html","post_modified":"2006-01-09 22:23:12","post_modified_gmt":"2006-01-10 03:23:12","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/2006/01/09/art-and-a-bit-of-software/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"148","post_author":"130","post_date":"2006-02-23 16:32:36","post_date_gmt":"2006-02-24 02:32:36","post_content":"I've been busy the past few weeks either by preparing, doing, or recovering from the ski trips I went on the past two weekends. The first one was to Wisp, down in Deep Creek Maryland. But why did I go down south to ski? Well, I got an offer last minute from a friend (Karen) ... and who can turn down a ski trip? We lucked out and the conditions were great. About 6 inches of fresh snow on arrival, and it snowed the entire weekend. Karen and I actually managed to make it through the weekend without killing each other (but that all fell through a few days after the trip). The only problem with the Wisp trip was my total utter failure doing 360s (which I've just started to get the hang of this year). Oh boy those mishaps (aka complete crash landings) left a mark -- but fortunately all bones still intact. And how can I not mention the hot tub snow angels? Good times.\r\n\r\nI came back late Monday night  (in fact catching the last red line T home) to try and rush together things for v-day. Fortunately, I had at least planned a bit ahead and gotten reservations the week prior, but there were plenty of other little things to get done (clean!). Reservations were at 9:00pm at Flora in Arlington but that's the best I could scrape up -- I didn't know how crazy the city gets on Valentines, next time I'll know that you have to plan that wayyy ahead of time. The dinner was a bit more elegant than I'm used to, but still good. Overall, I think it went well and I even got some homemade cookies. Thanks Cindy :)\r\n\r\nThis past weekend I was in Killington with the fam. Its funny to say that the conditions in Maryland were better than Vermont (I've yet to have good conditions skiing in NE). At least Killington has pretty good snow making so the mornings were ok, but in the afternoon the slopes were practically solid ice. It wasn't horrible though, and we managed to still have a good time and do all the typical family bonding (aka ragging on each other constantly). I was a bit more reserved this trip, especially after I bruised my other hip falling off a box when boarding. I told myself that was all the extreme I needed for the trip... but I couldn't prevent myself the next day on my ski boards. I managed to stay away from the rails and any special trips and stuck to seeing how far I could fly through the air. That one gigantic jump at the bottom of bear mountain was just too tempting :). I managed to get the courage  to go off of it twice and I actually cleared the table top on the second try. I wish I could have gotten a picture of that, I must have been 10-15 feet in the air and cleared 15-20 feet on the ground. Now that's a thrill.\r\n\r\nSo now I'm again recovering. Soccer was painful last week, but tonight... owch. I definitely was diving much less on my left side than I should have. And we ended with a tie... I so shouldn't have let a couple of those goals in :(. Hopefully I won't still have black and blue hips next week.

I was a bit worried that it would be a bit too crude-and-corny-and-not-really-a-musical, but I was wrong :). The show was incredibly funny and actually more muscial-ish than I expected (though the singing couldn't come close to those other \"real\" shows). I guess it didn't win the 2005 Tony Award for nothing.\r\n\r\nGoing into the show I was looking forward to seeing my favorite parts of the movie* - scenes with the Knights of Ni, \"Bring out yer dead\", and the Black Knight. All were in the show with some sort of modification. I wasn't quite ready for the bring out yer dead shtick to become an upbeat dance tune (though I have to admit it was catchy). The Black night was still as gruesome as ever (I've still got me teeth!). Though the best by far was the Knights of Ni who became \"the Knights who say Icci, Icci, bootang, Zoip ... Its hard out here to be a pimp.. (rhythm and rapping for a few minutes) ... for shizzle\". We were rolling in our seats :). Fun times.\r\n\r\nI'll be flying over to Cincinatti this weekend to see the Reds opening day with my baseball-fanatic-girlfriend (her hometown). Oh, and the president will be there (he must have heard I was going) :)\r\n\r\n* There are too many other good parts to try and limit myself to just a few good ones. The show still had the self-affacing monks, the rabbit with big claws (like this), the holy hand-grenade (five is right out!), and many others. I did miss the \"What is your favorite color?\" though.","post_title":"Not dead yet...","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"not-dead-yet","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2006-03-29 00:34:17","post_modified_gmt":"2006-03-29 05:34:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/2006/03/28/not-dead-yet/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"4"},{"ID":"150","post_author":"130","post_date":"2006-04-05 08:44:08","post_date_gmt":"2006-04-05 13:44:08","post_content":"This past weekend I flew on over to Cincinnati (with a \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/123536575/in/set-72057594099187960/\"\u003elong layover\u003c/a\u003e in Detroit) to see the Red's opening day with Cindy.

I've been an avid firebug user the minute I first heard about it -- starting with the initial appeal of CSS inspection, then integrated error reporting, and then getting hooked on the interactive javascript console. Firebug .3 was a big step up from the built in DOM inspector, but still it had its problems with generated content, a quirky debugger, and the inability to see inherited styles.\r\n\r\nThen firebug 1.0 came along obliterating these problems and brought a ton (no a metric *#$! ton) of great new functionality. Its sad enough that I'm extolling a piece of software publicly... its even sadder that I was jumping up and down (literally) in my apartment when I first tried out firebug 1.0 beta. Yeesh...\r\n\r\nBut I do have a good excuse. I do a lot of web development, I practically live and breathe it (though I have not been doing it much on the side lately). If a tool came along that made you twice as productive for your job/hobby, you'd be happy too -- right?! And it is not just about productivity, its also about joy of use. I used to dread debugging nasty CSS issues. It sometimes took hours to figure out that that 3px gap was caused by a measly missing space between two selectors. Now I feel like I'm in control and am confident that bug will be easy to find (and fix)! So please, before you label me as too big of a dork remember that you'd be pretty happy too to find something that made your life so much easier :).\r\n\r\nSo for the doubtful, what can firebug do?\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eClick to inspect any part of the page to see its styles (and all the styles that have been inherited and/or overwritten), box model, dom properties, or html source\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eDynamic editing of the page. HTML, CSS, and javascript. Just click to edit a field. The page will update to your changes in real time. As a bonus the edit fields have auto-complete (just like every other place you can type)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eSolid javascript debugging with really quick and easy watch expressions. I knew that I should have been debugging instead of logging messages for a long time, but now I can finally use a debugger that isn't painful (sorry Venkman... and firebug .3).\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eProfiling!!\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eGraphic visualization of all the http requests made on a page, including everything you need to know for page optimization!!!\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eEasily navigate between contexts since nearly everything in firebug is a link. Want to look into the properties of a javascript object? Click it. Want to see the http headers of a request? Click it. Want to inspect an element in the source view? Click it. This UI paradigm easily leads to feature discovery since you'll always try to click on something to find out more about it -- and you will quickly realize that it just feels right.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eAnd many things are easily discoverable without a click. Just hover over any image string and a popup will appear. Same with variables while debugging and with hex colors (no more memorizing hex codes)!\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\nAnd after watching a \u003ca href=\"http://ajaxian.com/archives/joe-hewitt-firebug-power-user-demo\"\u003evideo of Joe Hewitt demoing his creation\u003c/a\u003e, I still learned more features:\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eWhen editing a numeric field such as padding just press up or down with the arrow keys to change the padding amount, slick!\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eExtremely simple conditional breakpoints. I used to think that you couldn't do that in firebug, but all you have to do is right click a breakpoint and type in an arbitrary javascript expression.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eAutomatic bookmarklet \"scrunching\" when copying from the multi-line console\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eKeyboard shortcuts.. I can't live without ctrl-shift-t and ctrl-shift-r in eclipse, and now I know I can do ctrl-shift-space in firebug. Oh and I finally found out that I can get rid of the Wed Developer Extension's shift-ctrl-c shortcut so I can use it for firebug :)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\nIf you still are not satiated, watch this \u003ca href=\"http://files.jnewland.com/firebug.mov\"\u003escreen cast\u003c/a\u003e.\r\n\r\n\u003ca title=\"Firebug is a free web development tool for Firefox\" href=\"http://www.getfirebug.com/?link=3\" /\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center\"\u003e\u003ca title=\"Firebug is a free web development tool for Firefox\" href=\"http://www.getfirebug.com/?link=3\"\u003e\u003cimg border=\"0\" alt=\"Firebug - Web Development Evolved\" src=\"http://www.getfirebug.com/images/firebug3.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\nGo and try it, and if you love it please \u003ca href=\"http://www.getfirebug.com/contribute.html\"\u003edonate\u003c/a\u003e to the guy.

With the last site, I had enough of all the spliced images, excessive shadows, and hacky html and CSS to pull it off. So this time I've stuck with a subtle color scheme, plenty of whitespace, and (practically) no images. I didn't only to go for the simple look, but to also make the usage of the site more simple. Those efforts include sensible minimum and maximum withs, different sidebars for the home page and individual pages, and improve readability with \u003ca title=\"vertical rhythm\" href=\"http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm\"\u003evertical rhythm\u003c/a\u003e. I still think that I need to make many adjustments (boy is text rhythm hard with variable sized content) but things are good enough for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few times in the past I've tried different efforts to update my blog more frequently, but here I go again trying something else. Even though I have not been blogging much at all the past year(s), I still have been creating and contributing content such as my pictures on \u003ca title=\"flickr\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin\"\u003eflickr\u003c/a\u003e, bookmarks on \u003ca title=\"del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/timmfin\"\u003edel.icio.us\u003c/a\u003e, and interesting sites I've \u003ca title=\"dugg\" href=\"http://digg.com/users/timmfin/news/dugg\"\u003edugg\u003c/a\u003e. When I started to get into \u003ca title=\"twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/timmfin\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e, I considered replacing my blog completely with twitter updates. That started the thought process and even though I'm not replacing the blog, I am keeping things more \"fresh\" with other content. I really like the idea that I can put things on  many different places on the web and yet still use it in one place. For those of you would really like to stalk me, you can keep tabs by looking at my \u003ca title=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://timmfin.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblelog\u003c/a\u003e (same content, just organized into one feed of info).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have it admit it was hard for the engineer in me to accept the fact that I'm not being very orthogonal. The \"issue\" here is that I'm putting similar content in different places. Some may say that del.icio.us, digg, and the shares from google reader all serve the same function so whats the point of using them all? The point is two fold... first in the case of del.icio.us and digg I really am using the two sites for different purposes. For me del.icio.us is my personal internet reference. Whenever I stumble upon a site that is useful (or could be useful in the future) I'll put it in del.icio.us so I can find it later (google search is good, but searching your own bookmarked references is much better). On the other hand, I'll digg sites that I find fun, interesting, or insightful. It is more of a way to share than to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat argument doesn't work so well for gReader shares and digg. I pretty much am using them for the same thing.  So that means I need to consolidate, right?\u003ca href=\"#footnote-07012007-1\"\u003e¹\u003c/a\u003e ... No, convenience is a feature. And simply creating a share in google reader is just one keystroke/button click. Maybe someday I'll try out the greasemonkey script that will insert a digg link inside the gReader interface, but for now I'm good.

I was originally inspired to join IBM to help work on the productization of the \u003ca href=\"http://domino.research.ibm.com/cambridge/research.nsf/a1d792857da52f638525630f004e7ab8/82869318e9f8f90385256cb80054bfb2?OpenDocument\"\u003eActivity Explorer\u003c/a\u003e research project (wahoo a new way to collaborate!).

This was great for me since I was one of the few people on the team that already had some web development skills. The period that followed was the best programming experience I've had so far in my life. We (me and my tech lead) were pumping out code left and right, righting decent tests, quickly getting a prototype usable, continually responding to feedback from use, and adding features all the time.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c!--nextpage--\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  Although things started to slow down as the requirements came in, the team expanded, and more people (aka management) got involved — we kept up great momentum for a long time. More and more people were using our deployment for Real Business Work™ which was great, but also kinda scary since people were worried about losing data and peeved by downtime. Iterations went by and the UI got more refined as the designers cranked out their magic and features were tweaked. We even removed some features that were too complex (but we probably should have simplified even more).\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  But things really started to slow down when managers started mentioning the devilish S-word... Ship. This rubber hit the road we had to ensure our i's were dotted and t's were crossed so we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot (no more idioms I swear!). Maybe those were details we actually forgot or \"chose\" to forget, but either way they needed fixing real soon now. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  By now I had earned more respect and responsibility on the team. Some of it was earned through hard work, some if it was being in the right place at the right time (I got the chance to try and fill in the shoes of a great senior developer we lost), and some of it was from just being a bold junior developer. But anyway... I had gotten to the point where I was doing my normal developer \"day job\", trying to lead a small team, and help out and do other various work here that was needed and was not getting done.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  This is where things started to get more complicated.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  One thing that sticks out (since it frustrated me to no end) was getting lured into to owning some part of the project. It starts out by hearing that there is some new or unforeseen feature or problem needs work. All developers are already fully assigned, but it has to get done. Next, someone with a bit initiative (aka guilty sucker) steps up and says, \"That isn't hard to implement. I can code it up.\"\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  I have now since learned where that leads. By volunteering to do extra work you inevitably end up owning this work. In other words, you are on the hook to fix, support, and document the things you were being nice for doing in the first place! The funny thing is that no body ever asked you. The just assumed since you've already started it, you might as well do it all.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c!--nextpage--\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  True, having to do extra work is a part of the job description to some extent, but I feel like I ended up doing it far too often. At the time I couldn't point my finger on exactly why this irked me so much, but later I realized that I simply felt like my generosity was used. It's one thing to help out and then be asked to own and continue working on it, but it is totally different to be forced into a commitment that you never committed to!\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  Some of this was my own fault. Part of stepping up and taking on responsibility is realizing what you are getting yourself into and what you can handle. Little did I know how much things are different at the end of a product cycle compared to the beginning. Fortunately I got my way through it, and I have to admit I think I did a pretty good job. Especially considering that I was learning what a product cycle was like at the same time I was trying to lead through one. But unfortunately, I personally came out of it for the worse. I was getting burned out, feeling too responsible, and trying to do too much.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  But hey this is the real world, live and learn!

This has given me the   chance relax and try to more objectively look back at my two years at Lotus. I   still do think that many of my frustrations were valid, but I can't fault IBM   too much for that. Not only was I young and learning (the hard way), but  enterprise software development is hard to do. And trying to do something  innovative and enterprisy at the same time is even harder to do. There are  just so many details to worry about — configuration, security, databases,  ldaps, accessibility, localization, bidirectionality, integration, and most of all trying to appease the desires of waayy too many people — which ends up  washing out what is supposed to be the important part. Building quality  software that people want to use. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp style=\"\"\u003e\r\n  So that is what I'm off to try and do. I now know that enterprise product development is not where I want to be, at least right now. I'm surprised so many people are just fine with that sort of job, but I have no interest to ride that roller coaster.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e","post_title":"Saying good bye to Lotus...","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"164","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2007-08-13 10:33:00","post_modified_gmt":"2007-08-13 15:33:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/2007/08/13/164/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"165","post_author":"130","post_date":"2007-08-19 19:39:24","post_date_gmt":"2007-08-20 00:39:24","post_content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca title=\"Image11\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/91743262\"\u003e\r\n\u003cimg width=\"180\" height=\"240\" class=\"flickrwrapper\" alt=\"Image11\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/91743262_88d8384886_m.jpg\"/\u003e\r\n\u003c/a\u003e\r\nIn-between my job switching, I convinced Cindy to come with me and some of my family to hang out in Nags Head, NC.

In a sense, they are. One of the defining qualities of organizations since there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable parts. This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting wars. For most of history a well-drilled army of professional soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors, no matter how valorous. But having ideas is not very parallelizable. And that's what programs are: ideas.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd some interesting thoughts from the \u003ca href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45698\"\u003ecomments\u003c/a\u003e:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cblockquote\u003eOne possible alternative organization pattern is the \"band.\" ...\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to see how a band-style organization would apply towards more practical software products. Software so produced would come in boxes with the band's logo, but more importantly, a _list of credits_, anecdotes about the software's creation, etc. That is, to make the delivery of the software more _human_.\r\n\r\nBack in the day, when credits on software were more commonplace, it was possible to judge the quality of a product (to some extent) based on who was involved with it. Some people became reknowned coders, reknowned technical writers, etc. I think it gave two incentives: first, your name is going on the box of that package -- this gave prestige in the community post-sale; second, it allowed the customers to predict the overall feel of the software prior to actually purchasing it, based on their experiences with software written by the same or similar authors.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cbr/\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cblockquote\u003eThe only part I don't really agree with is the implicit condemnation of programming done by large companies. Yes, their methods result in mediocre software, but that's often what you want. There's a reason they try to treat programmers as interchangeable cogs, and resist having an entire program in one person's head.\r\n\r\nTo use the tired \"building a house\" metaphor - you can get a renowned architect to design the next landmark in a city, or you can get mediocre, interchangeable architects to design a row of townhouses. Both approaches are valid and have their own place, but there's no point asking the famous architect to build townhouses.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","post_title":"Paul Graham is spot on (as always)","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"paul-graham-is-spot-on-as-always","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2007-08-25 16:21:18","post_modified_gmt":"2007-08-25 21:21:18","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/2007/08/25/paul-graham-is-spot-on-as-always/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1"},{"ID":"173","post_author":"130","post_date":"2008-01-22 18:52:15","post_date_gmt":"2008-01-22 23:52:15","post_content":"\u003cem\u003ePosted as a comment to the \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/01/21/compatibility-and-ie8.aspx\"\u003eIE Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cblockquote\u003eYea, I know that IE is in a tough spot.

It only details the first weekend of our Europe trip, but at least its something.\u003c/i\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nIn the beginning of October, Cindy and I flew across the Atlantic to soak in the sights of middle/eastern Europe (and satisfy Cindy's annual \"I must leave the country\" requirement). I wasn't super keen on the idea originally, but she warmed me up to it and I figured I'd give this traveling thing a try.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\nWe first landed in Vienna and met up with Oggie, Cindy's friend/our travel guide/beer drinker extraordinaire. After a brief night tour of Vienna we got some sleep to prepare ourselves for the weekend... and what a whirlwind weekend it was.   \r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOggie had already picked up our rental car so we hit the road toward Munich on Saturday morning. We stopped along the way at a few small towns (Durnstein, Krems, Melk, Salzburg, Friesing ... no pics up yet of those). The towns were nice, Krems had some kind of political festival going on where people were carrying around colored balloons representing their favored candidate (Bush probably would be yellow, right?). Salzburg had some nice views and a human-sized chess board (that people were actually playing). We also swung by the oldest brewery in the world (11th century!)... they even had a Weihenstephaner \u003cspan class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 18px; font-family: arial;\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;\"\u003e\u003ca id=\"iyvx\" title=\"das boot\" href=\"http://www.truebeer.com/Two-Liter-Beer-Boot_p_1-176.html\"\u003edas boot\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe got to Munich in the evening and parked in a garage outside the gates of Oktoberfest. It didn't take long for us see where the party was going on since there were thousands of people out and having a good time. It seemed like most of them had been partying all day long, but fortunately not \u003ci\u003etoo\u003c/i\u003e many people were doing stupid things :) \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the beer tents (and by tent I mean 5000 person wooden structure) were packed to the gills, but we got lucky and squeezed ourselves into the \u003ca id=\"b8ru\" title=\"Löwenbräu beer hall\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/1699544129/in/set-72157602622595992/\"\u003eLöwenbräu beer hall (pic)\u003c/a\u003e. There is no doubt, we were the only sober people in there. The inside was lined with people standing on tables, singing and dancing (and drinking) their hearts out. The funny thing (if thousands of drunken dancing people isn't funny enough) was that Löwenbräu was the \"rock\" beer tent -- meaning that pretty much all the music was english and stuff we could sing along to. Unfortunately I can't remember the exact songs, but I do know there was some good ol' John Bovi (I've given in to my incessant mumbling of his name). Unfortunately we were only starting to really get into full swing (\u003ca id=\"w33v\" title=\"2nd liter of beer\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/1700394064/in/set-72157602622595992/\"\u003eafter two liters of beer\u003c/a\u003e) when the hall started to close at 11:30. Bummer.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe carnival atmosphere continued to live on after the tents closed. Particularly we were drawn to the a mob of guys staring into the fun house. We learned that Drunken men + women in Bavarian dresses + an unexpected floor updraft in the funhouse = a really enjoyable 15 mins. \u003c/p\u003e \r\n\r\n\u003c!--nextpage--\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few hours are a bit of a blur, but the jist of it was lots of (very cold) walking around in Munich. We trekked across to some of the typical tourist sites, but really there isn't too much to see at 2:00am in the morning. We stopped into a couple bars to warm up and have some more beer (and see a scary trans-dressing guy). We even found a bar open at 6:00am. We froze our butts off getting there (musta walked 2 complete circles in Munich already) but it was warm and we had breakfast. The other two continued to have yet more beer, but I wussed out at the point and had some water.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe eventually figured out that there was no way we were going to be able to stay up for another \u003ci\u003ewhole day\u003c/i\u003e so we headed back to the car hoping we'd figure out someplace to crash for a bit (hotels were booked loooong before we arrived). Even after 24 hrs of being awake we were wary of sleeping in our car in the garage, but our fears were alleved when we got back to the garage). Not only had we seen parked car after car with people sleeping on the streets, but the there were tons of people in the garage already sleeping in their car. The real kicker was the guy who was sprawled on the concrete outside of his car, with his car door wide open! I guess he passed out at a really inopportune time :)\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nWe woke up (rather unpleasantly) a few hours later and were thinking there was no way we were going to be able drink at 9:30 in the morning (much less last a whole day). But what did we go to Oktoberfest for... to drink beer of course! So we sucked it up and headed toward the tents. Our spirits were picked up by the surprising yet glorious sight of thousands and thousands of people making their way past the Oktoberfest gates (man these guys don't play around!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe looked around and started getting worried that we wouldn't be able to get seats, but there was still a some space in the Hofbräuhaus. We sat a little away from the thick of things, where the dedicated were already in full swing, and started to soak in the atmosphere. When the waitress came we sheepishly ordered our first beer and pretzel. But when we tasted it... oh my, definitely the best beer I've had in my life! And the pretzel was just as good -- warm, crispy, soft, salty, and yummy.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that instant the day went swimmingly. We forgot about our lack of sleep and had good times with the Germans and Americans that were seated around us. The \u003ca title=\"German guy right\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin/1699552831/in/set-72157602622595992/\" id=\"x25y\"\u003eGerman guy right\u003c/a\u003e next to us was hilarious. He told us all kinds of stories -- his times in America, why there was a large statue of a saint in the Hofbräuhaus, and how Oktoberfest beer is specially brewed. Really, the beer seemed to have magical bladder controlling properties . But the funny part was his stereotypes. The Colorado natives near us were goldiggers and cowboys, I (the programmer) was Bill Gates, and the Japanese guy was \"sushi samuri\".\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs the day moved on and the party heated up the band joined in on the fun. While the music in the Hofbräuhaus wasn't as contemporary as the previous night, it was still pretty familiar. The two tunes that stick out in my mind are Country Roads (by John Denver) and a europeanized version of \"Be my girl\". I don't quite understand why the germans would be singing about West Virginia. My best guess is that they have a fondness for drunken tunes and there is nothing better than raising a glass and belting \"Take me home/To the place/I BELOOONG...\" :)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom: 0.2in;\"\u003eThe other song though was a bit more weird. I knew the tune well enough and some of the words, but had no idea why \"If you'll be my girl\" could be so popular. It was definitely the hit of Oktoberfest and crowds all around were singing it (well before any of the bands played it). The biggest change (other than a general \"popification\" of the song) was a twist on the chorus. There was a bouncy musical run added on to \"know\" and a few grunts added after \"my girl\". That probably sounds pretty preposterous, and there has to be some reason why everyone in Oktoberfest knew (or quickly learned) the song, but really there is something to be said about drunken guttural noises :). \"I wanna kno oh oh oh ah oh, if you'll be my girl EW AH\" will be burnt in to my memory for quite some time.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c!--nextpage--\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nAt three o'clock it was time for us to leave the beer tents and make our way to the Bayern Munich football (soccer) game. We were pretty sad to have to leave Oktoberfest, but I was very excited to see a real European football match. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe Allianz Arena was quite a stadium to behold. It has a sleek, futuristic exterior styling that \u003ca title=\"looks metallic by day\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin/1699557515/in/set-72157602622595992/\" id=\"z5lr\"\u003elooks metallic\u003c/a\u003e by day and \u003ca title=\"glows red\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin/1699562015/in/set-72157602622595992/\" id=\"dtvv\"\u003eglows red\u003c/a\u003e by night. It really is quite a sight to see in the evening. The inside was nice, yet simple. There were bathrooms, food, and beer stands as expected but it didn't seem near as busy as the American baseball and football stadiums I've been in.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe match was awesome and certainly lived up to my expectations. FC Bayern soundly defeated FC Nürnberg (three to nil) with a generous show of offensive skill. While the match was enjoyable, the environment even better. American sports fans are no match for European football fans. Pure enthusiasm, singing, and shouting for 45 minutes. Then a break to prepare for another 45 minutes of... pure enthusiasm, singing, and shouting. There were no vendors, no beer runs, and rarely any bathroom \u003cstrike\u003eruns\u003c/strike\u003e visits. This is how sports should be experienced (and no, the standard \"Let's go Red Sox\" cheer sung in an awkward round around Fenway doesn't hold a candle to the entire-stadium-in-unison songs I heard in Munich).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eI almost forgot the best part (thanks for the reminder Cindy). When Bayern scores a goal the stadium goes nuts (of course), but when things quiet down, the announcer starts the post-goal cheer/ritual by proclaiming the first name of the goal scorer. Then the crowd yells the last name back in unison. Again the announcer says the first name, and the crowd chants back the last name. After repeating that process once more the announcer says \"number\" and the crowd yells back the goal scorer's number. To top it of the announcer finishes with \"Danke\" (thank you) and the crown crescendos for the final response, \"Bitte\" (you're welcome). You'll never hear a more guttural, aggressive, and yet jovial usage of \"you're welcome\". It may sound cheesy but that cheer was awesome... especially when you are ready to put your gut into it the second time around :).\u003c/p\u003e \r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo I left Munich with a huge smile on my face, already thinking of when I could visit once again. Unfortunately that high didn't last for long, since we had a long car ride ahead of us (which started out with a sobriety check the minute we got onto the highway). We ended up back in Vienna at 2:00am making a total of 40 hours with just a couple hours of sleep. I don't regret a single minute (.... well maybe we could have done without the 20 minutes of parking trouble when we got back).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nSo now I can finally say that I've traveled in Europe. I had actually been to Europe before, but going to Germany when you are 16 years old and caring only about the soccer tournament you are playing in doesn't really count.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e(Did I mention that only paying for 2 hotels for 10 nights in Europe is awesome! Thanks again Ogi)\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nI'm glad that I've started to open up to want to see more of the world, it actually deserves more credit than I initially gave it :)\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n","post_title":"The first weekend of our Europe trip","post_category":"0","post_excerpt":"","post_lat":null,"post_lon":null,"post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"175","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2008-06-04 21:30:10","post_modified_gmt":"2008-06-05 02:30:10","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://www.timmfin.net/2008/03/07/175/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},{"ID":"177","post_author":"130","post_date":"2008-06-06 15:01:15","post_date_gmt":"2008-06-06 20:01:15","post_content":"\u003cstyle\u003e\r\na.footnote {\r\nfont-size:85%;\r\nvertical-align:super;\r\nborder-bottom: none !important;\r\n}\r\n.flickr-wrapper-left {\r\nbackground-color:#FFFFFF;\r\nborder:1px solid #DDDDDD;\r\nfloat:left;\r\nmargin-bottom:10px;\r\nmargin-right:10px;\r\npadding:4px;\r\n}\r\n.flickr-wrapper-right {\r\nbackground-color:#FFFFFF;\r\nborder:1px solid #DDDDDD;\r\nfloat:right;\r\nmargin-bottom:10px;\r\nmargin-left:10px;\r\npadding:4px;\r\n}\r\n\u003c/style\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp id=\"fzdg0\"\u003e\u003ci id=\"fzdg1\"\u003eA look back at our very (very!) memorable engagement weekend.

After a quick stop at the information center, we parked, packed up our things and got out on the trail (around 9:30am). A few minutes in I realized I forgot my camera, so I ran back to the parking lot to grab it. I tried to run back up the trail, but that was a bad idea. Starting the hike completely winded wasn't helpful, especially because we were on the wrong trail\u003ca class=\"footnote\"  href=\"#lesson1\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e! We kept on wondering why the trail was so steep, and why the lake below was in the wrong place. After pouring over our map (thank you AMC guidebook!) we realized our error, but fortunately we were still going to the right destination (Cannon Mt). \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.1\"\u003eSo no biggie, we can handle 2000 ft of vertical in 2 miles, right? That was until we starting \u003ca id=\"yy5g\" title=\"seeing snow\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin/2538668613/in/set-72157605354919216/\"\u003eseeing snow\u003c/a\u003e. At first it was just little patches here and there, but eventually it covered the entire trail\u003ca class=\"footnote\" href=\"#lesson2\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e. I was getting worried. The trail is kicking our butts, it's cold, and we're trudging through snow (let me tell you, Cindy is not a fan of snow). I started second guessing whether I was going to do this or not. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.2\"\u003eEventually we reached the summit. Well, it wasn't exactly the summit, but it was darn close and had a \u003ca id=\"ifqt\" title=\"great view\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin/2538668989/in/set-72157605354919216/\"\u003egreat view\u003c/a\u003e. We took a break, soaked in the surroundings, \u003ca id=\"hw4j\" title=\"snapped some pictures\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/timmfin/2539491546/in/set-72157605354919216/\"\u003esnapped some pictures\u003c/a\u003e, and snacked a bit (anything I could use to stall and wait for the other couple up there to leave). When we were finally by ourselves I started getting really nervous. Cindy asked me if I was ready to get moving again (because she was probably freezing her butt off!), but convinced her to stay just a little bit longer. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.3\"\u003eSo it was now or never. I built up my courage, took her hand, got down on one knee, and started my spiel (sorry, those words are for Cindy only). My heart was racing, but fortunately I had rehearsed it enough that (I think) I didn't make a complete fool of myself. I had hidden the ring inside the breast pocket of my jacket wrapped in tissues and my glove liners. After what seemed like an eternity of unpacking, I offered her the ring and said, \"Will you marry me?\" I can't remember the next minute very well, I think I was too wrapped up in my own excitement to even hear her response. I had to double check with her to make sure she said yes :) \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.4\"\u003eAfter taking some time to celebrate, we got back on to the trail. It was only a short trip to the true summit, though we skipped the observation tower. We took a different route back down, which was the route that we were supposed to start out on. It was easier than before, but our legs were too wobbly to appreciate it. There was still some snow, but since we were coming down the other face of the mountain there were more puddles pools made from recently melted snow rather than the cold kind. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.5\"\u003eWe had a happy trip down, though I still hadn't relieved myself of all my worry yet. For a long while I couldn't stop apologizing. I said I was sorry for the snow, sorry for the cold, sorry taking so long to propose at the summit, etc. It was supposed to be perfect! It took a little while, but she eventually knocked some sense in to me. None of that mattered. All that mattered was that we were now happily engaged! (And little did I know how many more \"imperfections\" were to come!) \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.6\"\u003eWhen we reached the bottom of the mountain, we took another well deserved break. Refreshed by some more food and gatorade we set out on the flat and (supposedly) simple trail to go from where we should have parked to where we actually parked. It started off easily enough, but then the trail stopped. The map showed the trail following the left edge of a lake, but all we could see were the remnants of a few small bridges... which were inconveniently floating in the middle of the lake. No biggie, there was a bike road we intersected with a few minutes back, we'll just follow that back to the parking lot instead of the trail. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.7\"\u003eFull of pride from our showing of dexterity on the earlier pools of melted snow, I figured we could shortcut things by crossing a creek and plowing through a bit of forest -- instead of walking a few minutes. That wasn't a good idea\u003ca class=\"footnote\" href=\"#lesson3\"\u003e3\u003c/a\u003e. I was looking very fleet and nimble, until I lost my footing on a rock. I only ended up soaking one foot (I'd say a pretty good recovery), but we still had about another mile to go. Squish. Squish. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.8\"\u003eWearily we made it back to the car (and a got to finally take those wet socks off!). Earlier I had let Cindy in on another secret I had for the weekend. Instead of camping Saturday night, we had a room at the \u003ca id=\"iedb\" title=\"Woodstock Inn Station \u0026amp; Brewery\" href=\"http://www.woodstockinnnh.com/\"\u003eWoodstock Inn Station \u0026amp; Brewery\u003c/a\u003e. And it was no simple room either. We had a King bed, sofa, whirlpool jacuzzi, fireplace, and a refridgerator to cool the champagne I bought. So we had so time to relax (aka nap), sip champagne, and sooth our muscles before dinner. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.9\"\u003eWe ate at the Clement Room Grille and boy, what a meal. I had a filet with scallops, crabmeat, and hollandaise sauce and Cindy had smoke grilled salmon glazed with butter and New Hampshire maple syrup. Fantastic. We topped it off with Mouse Tracks pie for desert which was also excellent, but stuffed ourselves so much that we couldn't stop by the bar afterward and try our their microbrew. Bummer, we'll have to go back someday :). \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.10\"\u003eWhen I woke up in the morning, I had completely forgotten to dry my hiking boots out. So as we were getting ready and using the last of the champagne for mimosa, I stuffed the shoes with paper towels and set up an apparatus with the shoes and a clothes hanger to keep them nice and close to the fire. We headed off to breakfast, casting a wary glance at the fireplace, but pretty confident that leaving the fire on for a hour or so would be fine (it was a gas fireplace after all). But when we got back from yummy waffles and french toast, something was definitely wrong. The room smelled awful and it didn't take long to notice the malformed shoes by the fire\u003ca class=\"footnote\" href=\"#lesson4\"\u003e4\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.11\"\u003eThis was a problem. I was up for attempting to wear the something-boot-esqe things, but Cindy would have none of it (she was definitely right). When we checked out, we got directions to a few local places where we might find hiking shoes. Thankfully, a ski shop nearby did the trick. The boots were a bit expensive, but they fit. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ca id=\"h3ka0\" title=\"There it was! by timmfin, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmfin/2539495124/\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"flickr-wrapper-right\" id=\"h3ka1\" height=\"240\" alt=\"There it was!\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2208/2539495124_253487b4dc_m.jpg\" width=\"190\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \r\n\u003cp id=\"iar.12\"\u003eWe eventually got to the trail head around 10:30am.
